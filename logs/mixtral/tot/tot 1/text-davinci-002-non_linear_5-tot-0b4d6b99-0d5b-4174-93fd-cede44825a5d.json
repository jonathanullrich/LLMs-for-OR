Keep your answers concise.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.", "output": ["Choice 0:  This is a linear programming problem. We can solve it using the simplex method or graphical method. The simplex method is more suitable for high-dimensional problems, so let's use that. We will convert the inequalities to equalities by adding slack variables, set up the objective function, and then apply the simplex method to find the optimal solution.\nChoice 1:  The problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem:\n\nMaximize:\nz = 360*x1 (first 15 units of Product 1) + 30*(x1 - 15) (additional units of Product 1) + 240*x2 (first 20 units of Product 2) + 120*(x2 - 20)^+ + 90*(x2 - 40)^+ (additional units of Product 2) + 450*x3 (first 20 units of Product 3) + 300*(x3 - 20)^+ + 180*(x3 - 30)^+\n\nSubject to:\nx1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\n3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200\nx1 + 2*x3 <= 70\nx1, x2, x3 >= 0\n\nwhere (y)^+ = max(y, 0)\nChoice 2:  The problem can be formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem, where we want to maximize the profit function subject to given constraints. The constraints are in the form of inequalities, and they are all linear. The objective function, representing the total profit, can also be expressed as a linear function in terms of the decision variables x1, x2, and x3.\n\nObjective Function:\n- Profit = $360x1 + $30(x1 - 15) + $240x2 + $120(x2 - 20)^+ + $450x3 + $300(x3 - 20)^+ + $180(x3 - 30)^+\n- Here, (y)^+ = y if y > 0, 0 otherwise.\n\nConstraints:\n- x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\n- 3x1 + 2x2 <= 200\n- x1 + 2x3 <= 70\n\nAfter setting up the LP problem, you can apply a simplex method or other optimization techniques to find the solution.\n\nConfidence: 95%", " The best choice is 1.
