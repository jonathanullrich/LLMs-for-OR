{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Keep your answers concise.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "output": ["Choice 0:  This is a linear programming problem. We can set up a mathematical model with two decision variables, x1 and x2, representing the number of units of product 1 and product 2 to produce, respectively. The objective is to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit = 1*x1 + 2*x2\n\nsubject to the constraints:\n\n1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (frame parts)\n2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (electrical components)\nx1 >= 0, x2 >= 0 (non-negativity)\nx2 <= 60 (upper limit on product 2)\n\nWe can then solve this linear programming problem using simplex algorithm or other optimization techniques to find the optimal values of x1 and x2, and calculate the resulting total profit.\nChoice 1:  We can set up a linear programming problem with profit as the objective function and constraints for the number of available frame parts and electrical components. Since the number of units produced for product 2 is capped at 60, we can express the objective function as:\n\nMaximize z = 1*x1 + 2*x2\n\nSubject to:\n- 1*x1 + 3*x2 \u2264 200 (frame parts)\n- 2*x1 + 2*x2 \u2264 300 (electrical components)\n- x2 \u2264 60 (units of product 2 constraint)\n- x1, x2 \u2265 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nSolving this linear programming problem will give us the optimal values of x1 and x2, and we can calculate the resulting total profit from those values.\nChoice 2:  This is a linear programming problem. We can use the simplex method or other optimization techniques to solve it. \n\nLet's denote:\n\n- x1 as the number of units of product 1\n- x2 as the number of units of product 2\n\nObjective function (maximize profit):\n\n- z = 1*x1 + 2*x2\n\nConstraints:\n\n- 1*x1 + 3*x2 \u2264 200 (frame parts)\n- 2*x1 + 2*x2 \u2264 300 (electrical components)\n- x1 \u2265 0\n- x2 \u2264 60\n- x2 \u2265 0\n\nWe want to find the optimal values for x1 and x2 that maximize the objective function while satisfying all constraints.\n\n(Note: We will need to consider two cases for x2 due to the upper bound constraint.)", " The best choice is 0, 1, or 2. These choices all describe the same linear programming problem with different levels of detail. The problem can be set up as a linear programming problem with the objective of maximizing the profit function subject to the given constraints.

The results are then printed out. Note that the problem is not solved yet, and the `solve()` method is called only after the model is completely defined.\nChoice 2: We can use the pulp library in Python to model the linear programming problem.
