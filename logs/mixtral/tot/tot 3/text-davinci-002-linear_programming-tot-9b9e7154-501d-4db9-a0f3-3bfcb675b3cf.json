{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Keep your answers concise.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "output": ["Choice 0:  We can formulate this problem as a linear programming problem with two constraints (frame parts and electrical components) and two decision variables (number of units of product 1 and 2). The objective function would be the profit, and we want to maximize it.\n\nLet x1 be the number of units of product 1 and x2 be the number of units of product 2.\n\nObjective function: Maximize z = 1*x1 + 2*x2 (where x2 is less than or equal to 60)\n\nConstraints:\n1. 1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (frame parts)\n2. 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (electrical components)\n\nWe will solve this linear programming problem to find the resulting total profit.\nChoice 1:  The problem can be solved using a technique called Linear Programming (LP). We will formulate a linear objective function, representing the profit, and subject it to constraints of available frame parts and electrical components. The goal is to maximize the objective function while satisfying the constraints.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 1x + 2y\nSubject to:\n1) 1x + 3y <= 200 (frame parts constraint)\n2) 2x + 2y <= 300 (electrical components constraint)\n3) x, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n4) y <= 60 (upper limit for product 2)\n\nHere, x and y are the number of units of product 1 and product 2 to produce, respectively.\nChoice 2:  This is a profit maximization problem with constraints on available resources (frame parts and electrical components). We can use a linear programming approach, setting up the objective function and constraints as inequalities. First, let's denote the number of units of product 1 as x1 and the number of units of product 2 as x2. Now, we can set up the objective function:\n\nMaximize: Z = 1*x1 + 2*x2\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (frame parts)\n2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (electrical components)\nx1 >= 0\nx2 <= 60\nx2 >= 0\n\nNow we can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex method or other optimization algorithms.\n\nNote: I assume that producing no units of product 2 is allowed, as there's no explicit statement that x2 must be greater than 0. Otherwise, we should modify the x2 <= 60 constraint to 0 <= x2 <= 60, ensuring that we produce a non-negative amount of product 2.", " The best choice is 0, 1, or 2, as they all describe the same approach: formulating and solving a linear programming problem.
