Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "output": ["Choice 0: 1. Calculate the minimum cost for purchasing the required pints from each person today and tomorrow.\n2. Compare the costs and choose the minimum cost option while satisfying Tom's thirst requirements.\n\n(Step 3: Implement the solution using linear programming or integer programming if the problem is extended to more than two people or more than two days.)\nChoice 1: 1. First, for each seller, calculate the total cost of buying the desired quantity of home brew today and tomorrow.\n2. Choose the seller(s) that result in the lowest total cost for Tom, subject to their availability.\n3. If both sellers can provide the desired quantity at the same minimum total cost, purchase from the seller with a higher availability to ensure Tom's requirements are met.\n4. If neither seller can provide the desired quantity at the same minimum total cost, purchase from the seller with the lower total cost.\n5. If neither seller can provide the desired quantity in total, calculate the shortfall and notify Tom of the situation.\nChoice 2: Model the problem as a linear integer program with decision variables for the amount of home brew purchased from each person today and tomorrow, subject to constraints on the total amount purchased and the maximum availability of each seller. The objective function is the total cost, to be minimized.\n\nConcretely:\n\nVariables:\n\n* x1: pints of home brew purchased from Dick today\n* x2: pints of home brew purchased from Dick tomorrow\n* y1: pints of home brew purchased from Harry today\n* y2: pints of home brew purchased from Harry tomorrow\n\nObjective function: minimize C = 3x1 + 2.7x2 + 2.9y1 + 2.8y2\n\nConstraints:\n\n* x1 + y1 = 3 (Tom's thirst requirements today)\n* x2 + y2 = 4 (Tom's thirst requirements tomorrow)\n* x1 \u2264 5 (Dick's maximum availability today)\n* x2 \u2264 5 (Dick's maximum availability tomorrow)\n* y1 \u2264 4 (Harry's maximum availability today)\n* y2 \u2264 4 (Harry's maximum availability tomorrow)\n* x1, x2, y1, y2 \u2265 0 (non-negativity)\n* x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers (discrete pints)\n\nThis is a linear integer program, which can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers like CPLEX, Gurobi, or open-source solvers like GLPK, COIN-OR, etc.\n\nThe next steps would involve encoding this problem in your favorite solver.
