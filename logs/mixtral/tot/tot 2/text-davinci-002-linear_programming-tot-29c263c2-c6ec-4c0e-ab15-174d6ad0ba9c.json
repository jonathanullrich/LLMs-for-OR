{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Keep your answers concise.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "output": ["Choice 0:  We can formulate this as a linear programming problem. Let x be the number of units of product 1, and y be the number of units of product 2. Our objective function is to maximize the profit function:\n\nProfit(x, y) = 1*x + 2*y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1*x + 3*y <= 200 (frame parts constraint)\n2*x + 2*y <= 300 (electrical components constraint)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\ny <= 60 (upper limit on product 2)\n\nWe'll use the simplex method or another optimization algorithm to solve this linear programming problem.\nChoice 1:  This is a linear programming problem. We have two constraints (frame parts and electrical components) and two decision variables (units of product 1 and units of product 2). The objective function is to maximize profit. We can set up the problem as follows:\n\nMaximize:\n1x + 2y\n\nSubject to:\nx + 3y <= 200 (frame parts constraint)\n2x + 2y <= 300 (electrical components constraint)\n\nWhere x is the number of units of product 1 and y is the number of units of product 2.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the constraints by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients on the left side:\n\nx + 3y <= 200\nx + y <= 100\n\n2x + 2y <= 300\nx + y <= 150\n\nSince the first constraint is more restrictive than the second, we can ignore the second constraint. Now, we can graph the feasible region and find the vertices. Evaluate the objective function at each vertex to determine the one that maximizes the profit.\nChoice 2:  This is a linear programming problem. We want to maximize profit subject to certain constraints, namely the availability of frame parts and electrical components. We have two decision variables: x = number of units of product 1 and y = number of units of product 2.\n\nObjective function: Maximize profit = 1x + 2y\n\nConstraints:\n- Frame parts constraint: 1x + 3y \u2264 200\n- Electrical components constraint: 2x + 2y \u2264 300\n- Non-negativity constraint: x \u2265 0 and y \u2265 0\n\nWe can rewrite the first constraint as x \u2264 200 - 3y. Since y is non-negative, we can simplify this to x \u2264 200.\n\nWe can solve this linear programming problem using the simplex algorithm or a package like scipy.optimize.linprog in Python.\n\nThe solution will give us the optimal values of x and y that maximize the profit. To find the actual profit, we'll use the objective function with these values.", " The best choice is 0.

The problem is named \"WorldLightCompany\" and the objective is to maximize the profit. The decision variables are `x` (units of product 1) and `y` (units of product 2). The constraints are defined using the `prob` object, and finally, the problem is written to a .lp file for easy viewing.\nChoice 2: To model this problem, let's use the PuLP library in Python.
