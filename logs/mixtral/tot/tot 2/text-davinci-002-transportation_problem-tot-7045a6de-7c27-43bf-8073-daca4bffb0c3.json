Calculate the total cost for purchasing 3 pints from Dick today and 4 pints from Dick tomorrow.\n4. Compare the costs and choose the one that is minimum.\n5. The option with the minimum cost will determine the purchases to be made by Tom from Dick and Harry to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements.\nChoice 1: 1. First, determine the minimum cost to buy 3 pints from Tom's options (today) and 4 pints from Tom's options (tomorrow).\n2.
