{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Keep your answers concise.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "output": ["Choice 0:  This is a linear programming problem. We can set up a mathematical model with objective function and constraints:\n\nObjective Function:\nMaximize profit = 1x + 2y\n\nConstraints:\nFrame parts: x + 3y \u2264 200\nElectrical components: 2x + 2y \u2264 300\nNumber of product 2: y \u2264 60\n\nNon-negativity:\nx \u2265 0\ny \u2265 0\n\nWe need to find integer values for x and y that maximize the profit while satisfying all constraints.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use simplex algorithm, graphical method, or an optimization solver like CPLEX, Gurobi, or even Excel Solver.\nChoice 1:  This is a linear programming problem. We have two constraints (frame parts and electrical components), and we want to maximize profit. Since each product has a different requirement for resources and profit margin, we can create a mathematical model to solve this problem.\n\nThe objective function would be the sum of the profits from producing x units of product 1 and y units of product 2. The constraints are the available resources (200 frame parts and 300 electrical components). We need to ensure that the resources required to produce x and y units do not exceed the available amounts.\n\nOnce the constraints and objective function are set up, we can use a linear programming algorithm, such as the simplex method, to find the optimal solution.\n\nThe resulting total profit will be the sum of profits from both products, given the optimal production quantities x and y.\nChoice 2:  We can formulate this problem as a linear programming problem with two constraints (frame parts and electrical components) and two decision variables (number of product 1 and product 2 units). The objective function will represent the profit, and there will be non-negativity constraints to ensure that the production of both products is non-negative.\n\nObjective Function: Maximize total profit (Z)\nZ = 1 * X1 + 2 * X2 (where X1 is the number of product 1 units, X2 is the number of product 2 units)\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. Frame Parts constraint: 1 * X1 + 3 * X2 <= 200\n2. Electrical Components constraint: 2 * X1 + 2 * X2 <= 300\n3. Non-negativity constraints: X1 >= 0, X2 >= 0\n\nWe want to find the optimal values for X1 and X2 that maximize the objective function while satisfying the constraints.\n\nAdditionally, since product 2's profit contribution drops to $0 after 60 units, we should consider two distinct cases for the production of product 2:\n\n1. Case 1: Up to 60 units of product 2\n2. Case 2: Fewer than 60 units of product 2, along with additional production of product 1\n\nSolve each case and take the one with the higher profit.", " The best choice is 2. This choice provides a detailed formulation of the problem as a linear programming problem, including the objective function, constraints, and non-negativity conditions. Moreover, it highlights the importance of considering two distinct cases for the production of product 2, which is crucial to finding the optimal solution. This approach ensures that the profit contribution of product 2 is maximized while adhering to the given constraints.", "Choice: 2", "Choice 0:  Here's a Python code using the PuLP library to model the problem.
