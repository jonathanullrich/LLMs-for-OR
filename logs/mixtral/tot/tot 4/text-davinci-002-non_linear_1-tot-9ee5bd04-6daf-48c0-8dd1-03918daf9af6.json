Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "output": ["Choice 0:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the tax revenue function, which is the product of the tax rate and the number of cigarettes smoked.

We can then take the derivative of this revenue function with respect to the tax rate, set it to zero, and solve for the tax rate to find the maximum tax revenue point.\n\nThe tax revenue (R) is given by:\n\nR = t * (f * n)\n\nwhere f is the demand function, t is the tax rate, and n is the number of smokers.\n\nGiven f = 53 - 100*(t/100), we can express R in terms of t and n. After finding the critical point, we can use the second derivative test to confirm that it is a maximum.\nChoice 2:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the tax revenue by considering both the tax rate and the resulting change in consumption. The tax revenue (R) will be the product of the tax rate (t), the base price (b), and the number of cigarettes consumed (f): R = t * b * f. Since f depends on t, we can write R as a function of t: R(t) = t * b * (53 - 100*(t/100)). To find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we need to compute the maximum of R(t). This can be done by finding the critical points of the function and verifying if the maximum occurs at one of those points or at the boundaries.", " The best choice is 2.
