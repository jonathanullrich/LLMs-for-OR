Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem:\n1. We need to minimize Tom's cost while satisfying his thirst requirements.\n2. Tom needs 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow.\n3. Dick sells up to 5 pints total, with prices $3.00/pint today and $2.70/pint tomorrow.\n4. Harry sells up to 4 pints total, with prices $2.90/pint today and $2.80/pint tomorrow.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the possible costs for purchasing pints from Dick and Harry separately. If Tom buys all pints from Dick today and tomorrow, the cost will be:\n\nDick\\_today = 3 * 3.00\nDick\\_tomorrow = 4 * 2.70\n\nIf Tom buys all pints from Harry today and tomorrow, the cost will be:\n\nHarry\\_today = 3 * 2.90\nHarry\\_tomorrow = 4 * 2.80\n\nNow, let's consider the case where Tom buys some pints from Dick and some from Harry, both today and tomorrow. We can represent the costs as follows:\n\nDick\\_today\\_part = x * 3.00\nDick\\_tomorrow\\_part = y * 2.70\nHarry\\_today\\_part = (3 - x) * 2.90\nHarry\\_tomorrow\\_part = (4 - y) * 2.80\n\nHere, x and y are the number of pints Tom buys from Dick today and tomorrow, respectively. We need to ensure that x and y are non-negative, and the total number of pints from Dick and Harry don't exceed their limits.\n\nx + y <= 5 (Dick's limit)\n(3 - x) + (4 - y) <= 4 (Harry's limit)\n\nThe cost for this scenario will be:\n\nCost = Dick\\_today\\_part + Dick\\_tomorrow\\_part + Harry\\_today\\_part + Harry\\_tomorrow\\_part\n\nOur goal is to minimize this cost while satisfying Tom's thirst requirements. We can use linear programming to find the optimal solution.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
