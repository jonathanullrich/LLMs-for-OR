{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. Define the variables:\n   - Investment for Friend 1: x (in dollars)\n   - Hours for Friend 1: y (in hours)\n   - Investment for Friend 2: z (in dollars)\n   - Hours for Friend 2: w (in hours)\n\n2. We have some constraints:\n   - Investment constraint: x + z = $12,000 (you have $12,000 to invest in both ventures)\n   - Time constraint: y + w \u2264 600 hours (you have a maximum of 600 hours for both ventures)\n\n3. The objective is to maximize the profit:\n   - Profit for Friend 1: $9,000 * (x / $10,000)\n   - Profit for Friend 2: $9,000 * (z / $8,000)\n\nNow let's write Python code to solve this problem using the `scipy.optimize` library:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the objective function\ndef objective_function(variables):\n    x, z, y, w = variables\n    return [9 * x / 10, 9 * z / 8, -y - w + 600]\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef constraints(variables):\n    x, z, y, w = variables\n    return [x + z - 12000, -x + 10 * y, -z + 8 * w]\n\n# Define the bounds\nbounds = [(0, 12000), (0, 12000), (0, 600), (0, 600)]\n\n# Solve the linear programming problem\nres = linprog(c=objective_function, A_ub=constraints(None), b_ub=np.array([0, 0, 600]), bounds=bounds, method='simplex')\n\n# Assign the solution\nsolution = res.x[0] + res.x[1]\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable now contains the optimal total estimated profit.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the objective function\ndef objective_function(variables):\n    x, z, y, w = variables\n    return [9 * x / 10, 9 * z / 8, -y - w + 600]\n\n# Define the constraints\ndef constraints(variables):\n    x, z, y, w = variables\n    return [x + z - 12000, -x + 10 * y, -z + 8 * w]\n\n# Define the bounds\nbounds = [(0, 12000), (0, 12000), (0, 600), (0, 600)]\n\n# Solve the linear programming problem\nres = linprog(c=objective_function, A_ub=constraints(None), b_ub=np.array([0, 0, 600]), bounds=bounds, method='simplex')\n\n# Assign the solution\nsolution = res.x[0] + res.x[1]", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
