The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! To find the minimal cost for Luxor Travel, we can use a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal number of weeks to keep each rental car. Here is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_cost(n_cars, weeks, rental_cost, flat_fee):\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n_cars + 1)] for _ in range(weeks)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, weeks):\n        for j in range(1, n_cars + 1):\n            if i == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = j * rental_cost + flat_fee\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][k] + (j - k + 1) * rental_cost + (k - 1) * flat_fee for k in range(1, j + 1))\n    \n    return dp[weeks - 1][n_cars]\n\nn_cars = 7 + 4 + 7 + 8  # total number of rental cars\nweeks = 4\nrental_cost = 220\nflat_fee = 500\n\nsolution = min_cost(n_cars, weeks, rental_cost, flat_fee)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nIn this code, `n_cars`, `weeks`, `rental_cost`, and `flat_fee` represent the total number of rental cars, the number of weeks, the rental fee per car per week, and the flat fee per rental transaction, respectively. The `min_cost` function calculates the minimum cost of renting the cars for `weeks` weeks by iterating over all possible combinations of rental lengths for each car. The final result is assigned to the `solution` variable.", "code": "def min_cost(n_cars, weeks, rental_cost, flat_fee):\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n_cars + 1)] for _ in range(weeks)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, weeks):\n        for j in range(1, n_cars + 1):\n            if i == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = j * rental_cost + flat_fee\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][k] + (j - k + 1) * rental_cost + (k - 1) * flat_fee for k in range(1, j + 1))\n    \n    return dp[weeks - 1][n_cars]\n\nn_cars = 7 + 4 + 7 + 8  # total number of rental cars\nweeks = 4\nrental_cost = 220\nflat_fee = 500\n\nsolution = min_cost(n_cars, weeks, rental_cost, flat_fee)\nprint(solution)", "solution": 6660}
