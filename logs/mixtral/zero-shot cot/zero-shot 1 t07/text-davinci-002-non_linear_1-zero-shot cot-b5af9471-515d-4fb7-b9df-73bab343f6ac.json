Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's first find the expression for tax revenue as a function of the tax rate. The tax revenue is obtained by multiplying the tax rate by the quantity demanded. So, we need to express the quantity demanded as a function of the tax rate, and then multiply it by the tax rate.\n\nLet's denote the quantity demanded by q(t), where t is the tax rate. We are given that q(t) = 53 - 100*(t/100). The tax revenue is then given by:\n\ntr(t) = t * q(t) = t * (53 - 100*(t/100))\n\nTo find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we need to find the maximum point of the function tr(t). We can do this by taking the derivative of tr with respect to t, setting it equal to zero, and solving for t.\n\nThe derivative of tr is:\n\ntr'(t) = 53 - 200*(t/100)\n\nSetting tr'(t) equal to zero and solving for t, we get:\n\n53 - 200*(t/100) = 0\n200*(t/100) = 53\nt/100 = 53/200\nt = 53/2\n\nSo, the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is t = 53/2 cents.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to compute the solution:\n\nsolution = 53/2\n\nThis will give us the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, in cents.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
