Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the employee-project matrix:\n```python\nemployee_project_matrix = [\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],  # Employee 1\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # Employee 2\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],  # Employee 3\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],  # Employee 4\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],  # Employee 5\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],  # Employee 6\n    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], ", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
