The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! To determine the minimal cost for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand, we can calculate the cost for each week separately and then sum them up. The cost for each week will depend on whether the rental cars from the previous week are kept or not.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of cars needed in each week\nrental_cars = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Define the rental fee and flat fee\nrental_fee = 220\nflat_fee = 500\n\n# Initialize the cost as 0\ncost = 0\n\n# Iterate through the weeks\nfor i in range(len(rental_cars)):\n    # If it's the first week, there's no flat fee to add\n    if i == 0:\n        cost += rental_cars[i] * rental_fee\n    # If it's not the first week, calculate the cost for this week based on whether to keep the cars or not\n    else:\n        # Calculate the cost for this week if the cars from the previous week are kept\n        cost_keep = (rental_cars[i] + rental_cars[i-1]) * rental_fee + flat_fee\n        # Calculate the cost for this week if the cars from the previous week are not kept\n        cost_no_keep = rental_cars[i] * rental_fee + flat_fee\n        # Choose the smaller cost between cost_keep and cost_no_keep\n        cost += min(cost_keep, cost_no_keep)\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = cost\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable will contain the minimal cost to handle the rental situation and customer demand for Luxor Travel.", "code": "# Define the number of cars needed in each week\nrental_cars = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Define the rental fee and flat fee\nrental_fee = 220\nflat_fee = 500\n\n# Initialize the cost as 0\ncost = 0\n\n# Iterate through the weeks\nfor i in range(len(rental_cars)):\n    # If it's the first week, there's no flat fee to add\n    if i == 0:\n        cost += rental_cars[i] * rental_fee\n    # If it's not the first week, calculate the cost for this week based on whether to keep the cars or not\n    else:\n        # Calculate the cost for this week if the cars from the previous week are kept\n        cost_keep = (rental_cars[i] + rental_cars[i-1]) * rental_fee + flat_fee\n        # Calculate the cost for this week if the cars from the previous week are not kept\n        cost_no_keep = rental_cars[i] * rental_fee + flat_fee\n        # Choose the smaller cost between cost_keep and cost_no_keep\n        cost += min(cost_keep, cost_no_keep)\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = cost", "solution": 7220}
