He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem using graph theory and the concept of a minimum spanning tree. We can represent the streets as edges in a graph, where each edge has a weight corresponding to the length of the street. We want to find the route that includes each street (edge) exactly once while starting and ending at point A. This is equivalent to finding a minimum spanning tree in the graph, and then traversing all the edges in the tree.\n\nHere's a Python code that uses the NetworkX library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Define the graph with streets as edges and their corresponding lengths as weights\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('A', 'C', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('B', 'C', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('B', 'D', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('D', 'E', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('D', 'F', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('E', 'F', weight=9)\nG.add_edge('E', 'G', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('F', 'G', weight=5)\nG.add_edge('G', 'H', weight=3)\n\n# Calculate the minimum spanning tree\nT = nx.minimum_spanning_tree(G)\n\n# Calculate the total length of the minimum spanning tree\nsolution = sum(T[u][v]['weight'] for u, v in T.edges())\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `add_edge` method of the NetworkX `Graph` class to define the graph with edges and their corresponding weights. We then use the `minimum_spanning_tree` method to find the minimum spanning tree, and sum up the weights of its edges to get the final solution.\n\nThe variable `solution` contains the total length of the route that goes through each street exactly once, starting and ending at point A.", "code": "import networkx as nx\n\n# Define the graph with streets as edges and their corresponding lengths as weights\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('A', 'C', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('B', 'C', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('B', 'D', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('D', 'E', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('D', 'F', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('E', 'F', weight=9)\nG.add_edge('E', 'G', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('F', 'G', weight=5)\nG.add_edge('G', 'H', weight=3)\n\n# Calculate the minimum spanning tree\nT = nx.minimum_spanning_tree(G)\n\n# Calculate the total length of the minimum spanning tree\nsolution = sum(T[u][v]['weight'] for u, v in T.edges())", "solution": 21}
