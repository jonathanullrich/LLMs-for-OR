Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem and come up with a plan to solve it using Python.\n\n1. Define the five swimmers and their best times in seconds for each of the four strokes (backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle).\n2. Create a function to calculate the total time for a given combination of swimmers and strokes.\n3. Define a function to find the minimum total time using all possible combinations of swimmers and strokes.\n4. Call the function to find the minimum total time and store the result in the 'solution' variable.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this plan:\n\n```python\n# Define the best times for each swimmer in each stroke\nbackstroke = {'Carl': 37.7, 'Chris': 32.9, 'David': 33.8, 'Tony': 37.0, 'Ken': 35.4}\nbreaststroke = {'Carl': 43.4, 'Chris': 33.1, 'David': 42.2, 'Tony': 34.7, 'Ken': 41.8}\nbutterfly = {'Carl': 33.3, 'Chris': 28.5, 'David': 38.9, 'Tony': 30.4, 'Ken': 33.6}\nfreestyle = {'Carl': 29.2, 'Chris': 26.4, 'David': 29.6, 'Tony': 28.5, 'Ken': 31.1}\n\n# Function to calculate the total time for a given combination of swimmers and strokes\ndef total_time(combination):\n    return (\n        backstroke[combination[0]]\n        + breaststroke[combination[1]]\n        + butterfly[combination[2]]\n        + freestyle[combination[3]]\n    )\n\n# Function to find the minimum total time using all possible combinations of swimmers and strokes\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_min_time():\n    all_combinations = list(itertools.permutations(backstroke.keys()))\n    min_time = float('inf')\n    best_combination = None\n\n    for combination in all_combinations:\n        time = total_time(combination)\n        if time < min_time:\n            min_time = time\n            best_combination = combination\n\n    return min_time, best_combination\n\nsolution = find_min_time()[0]\nprint(f'Minimum time spent: {solution:.2f} seconds')\n```\n\nThis code first defines the best times for each swimmer in each stroke. Then, it defines the 'total\\_time' function to calculate the total time for a given combination of swimmers and strokes. The 'find\\_min\\_time' function uses itertools to generate all possible combinations of swimmers and strokes and then calculates the total time for each combination. Finally, it finds and returns the combination with the minimum total time. The minimum time is stored in the 'solution' variable and printed in the end.", "code": "# Define the best times for each swimmer in each stroke\nbackstroke = {'Carl': 37.7, 'Chris': 32.9, 'David': 33.8, 'Tony': 37.0, 'Ken': 35.4}\nbreaststroke = {'Carl': 43.4, 'Chris': 33.1, 'David': 42.2, 'Tony': 34.7, 'Ken': 41.8}\nbutterfly = {'Carl': 33.3, 'Chris': 28.5, 'David': 38.9, 'Tony': 30.4, 'Ken': 33.6}\nfreestyle = {'Carl': 29.2, 'Chris': 26.4, 'David': 29.6, 'Tony': 28.5, 'Ken': 31.1}\n\n# Function to calculate the total time for a given combination of swimmers and strokes\ndef total_time(combination):\n    return (\n        backstroke[combination[0]]\n        + breaststroke[combination[1]]\n        + butterfly[combination[2]]\n        + freestyle[combination[3]]\n    )\n\n# Function to find the minimum total time using all possible combinations of swimmers and strokes\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_min_time():\n    all_combinations = list(itertools.permutations(backstroke.keys()))\n    min_time = float('inf')\n    best_combination = None\n\n    for combination in all_combinations:\n        time = total_time(combination)\n        if time < min_time:\n            min_time = time\n            best_combination = combination\n\n    return min_time, best_combination\n\nsolution = find_min_time()[0]\nprint(f'Minimum time spent: {solution:.2f} seconds')", "solution": 126.2}
