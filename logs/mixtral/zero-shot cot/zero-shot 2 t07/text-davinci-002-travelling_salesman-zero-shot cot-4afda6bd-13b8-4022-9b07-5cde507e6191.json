Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! The problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the projects that have employees in common.\n2. Create groups of employees who work on the same projects.\n3. Schedule a meeting for each group, and ensure that the meeting time does not overlap with any other meeting that includes employees from that group.\n4. Minimize the number of meetings required.\n\nWe can formulate this problem as a graph theory problem, where the nodes represent employees and the edges represent shared projects. Our objective is to partition the graph into the minimum number of independent sets, where each independent set corresponds to a meeting.\n\nHere's a Python code that uses the NetworkX library to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Define the employee-project assignments\nemployee_project = {\n    1: [2, 4, 5],\n    2: [1, 3, 5],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    4: [3, 4, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3],\n    6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    7: [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    8: [1, 3, 4],\n    9: [5, 6],\n    10: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n\n# Create a graph and add nodes and edges\nG = nx.Graph()\nfor employee, projects in employee_project.items():\n    G.add_node(employee)\n    for project in projects:\n        G.add_node(project)\n        G.add_edge(employee, project)\n\n# Find the maximum independent set\nsolution = nx.algorithms.independent_set.maximal_independent_set(G)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f\"The minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room is {len(solution)}\")\n```\nThe `solution` variable contains the minimum number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "code": "import networkx as nx\n\n# Define the employee-project assignments\nemployee_project = {\n    1: [2, 4, 5],\n    2: [1, 3, 5],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    4: [3, 4, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3],\n    6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    7: [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    8: [1, 3, 4],\n    9: [5, 6],\n    10: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n\n# Create a graph and add nodes and edges\nG = nx.Graph()\nfor employee, projects in employee_project.items():\n    G.add_node(employee)\n    for project in projects:\n        G.add_node(project)\n        G.add_edge(employee, project)\n\n# Find the maximum independent set\nsolution = nx.algorithms.independent_set.maximal_independent_set(G)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f\"The minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room is {len(solution)}\")", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
