Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! The goal is to maximize tax revenue, which is equal to the tax rate multiplied by the quantity demanded. To find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we first need to calculate the quantity demanded based on the given function f = 53 - 100*(t/100), and then find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue function, TR(t) = t * (53 - 100*(t/100)). Here's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef quantity_demanded(t):\n    return 53 - 100 * (t / 100)\n\ndef tax_revenue(t):\n    return t * quantity_demanded(t)\n\ndef find_max_tax_revenue():\n    max_t = 0\n    max_tr = 0\n    for t in range(0, 101, 1):\n        tr = tax_revenue(t)\n        if tr > max_tr:\n            max_t = t\n            max_tr = tr\n    return max_t\n\nsolution = find_max_tax_revenue()\n```\n\nThe `find_max_tax_revenue` function calculates the tax revenue for each possible tax rate from 0% to 100% with a step of 1% and keeps track of the tax rate that gives the highest tax revenue. The output is assigned to the variable 'solution'.", "code": "def quantity_demanded(t):\n    return 53 - 100 * (t / 100)\n\ndef tax_revenue(t):\n    return t * quantity_demanded(t)\n\ndef find_max_tax_revenue():\n    max_t = 0\n    max_tr = 0\n    for t in range(0, 101, 1):\n        tr = tax_revenue(t)\n        if tr > max_tr:\n            max_t = t\n            max_tr = tr\n    return max_t\n\nsolution = find_max_tax_revenue()", "solution": 26}
