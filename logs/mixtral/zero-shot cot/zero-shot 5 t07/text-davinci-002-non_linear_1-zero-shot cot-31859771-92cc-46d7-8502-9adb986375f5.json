Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem systematically.\n\n1. We are given a linear function that describes average daily consumption per smoker (f) in terms of the tax rate (t).\n2. The revenue from cigarette sales is tax rate multiplied by the number of cigarettes smoked daily (tax\\_revenue = t * f).\n3. We want to maximize the tax revenue (t * f) by selecting an appropriate tax rate (t).\n4. To achieve that, we'll calculate the derivative of the tax revenue function with respect to the tax rate (t) and set it to zero.\n5. Then, we'll solve for the tax rate (t) that maximizes the tax revenue.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbols\nt, f, tax_revenue = sp.symbols('t f tax_revenue')\n\n# Define the consumption function\nf_cons = 53 - 100 * (t/100)\n\n# Define the tax revenue function\ntax_revenue_func = t * f_cons\n\n# Find the derivative of tax_revenue_func with respect to t\ntax_revenue_derivative = tax_revenue_func.diff(t)\n\n# Solve for t when the derivative equals zero\nsolution = sp.solve(tax_revenue_derivative, t)\n\n# We are only interested in the positive solution\nsolution = float(solution[0]) if solution[0] > 0 else None\n```\n\nIn this case, the solution variable would contain the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. Note that this assumes the existence of a global maximum within the domain of the problem; this might not be the case for different functions or domains.", "code": "import sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbols\nt, f, tax_revenue = sp.symbols('t f tax_revenue')\n\n# Define the consumption function\nf_cons = 53 - 100 * (t/100)\n\n# Define the tax revenue function\ntax_revenue_func = t * f_cons\n\n# Find the derivative of tax_revenue_func with respect to t\ntax_revenue_derivative = tax_revenue_func.diff(t)\n\n# Solve for t when the derivative equals zero\nsolution = sp.solve(tax_revenue_derivative, t)\n\n# We are only interested in the positive solution\nsolution = float(solution[0]) if solution[0] > 0 else None", "solution": 26.5}
