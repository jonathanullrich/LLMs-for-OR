{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! The goal here is to maximize the total value of items that can fit in the backpack, given the volume constraints. This is a classic example of a knapsack problem, which is a type of integer programming problem.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef knapSack(capacity, weights, values, n):\n    # Create a table to store the maximum value that can be obtained\n    #", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
