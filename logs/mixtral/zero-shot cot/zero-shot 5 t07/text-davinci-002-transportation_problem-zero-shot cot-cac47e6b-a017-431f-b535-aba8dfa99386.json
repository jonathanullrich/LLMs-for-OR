Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to determine the minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Dick and 4 pints from Harry.\n2. Next, we need to determine the minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Tom today and the remaining pints from either Dick or Harry tomorrow.\n3. Finally, we compare the costs from steps 1 and 2, and choose the option with the minimum cost.\n\nHere's how we can write the code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\n# Prices per pint\nprice_dick_today = 3.00\nprice_dick_tomorrow = 2.70\nprice_harry_today = 2.90\nprice_harry_tomorrow = 2.80\n\n# Thirst requirements\npints_today = 3\npints_tomorrow = 4\n\n# Minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Dick and 4 pints from Harry\ncost_dh = price_dick_today * 3 + price_harry_tomorrow * 4\n\n# Minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Tom today and the remaining pints from either Dick or Harry tomorrow\nremaining_pints_tomorrow = pints_tomorrow - 3\n\ncost_tomorrow = min(price_dick_tomorrow, price_harry_tomorrow) * remaining_pints_tomorrow\ncost_today = price_tom_today * 3\ncost_tom = cost_today + cost_tomorrow\n\n# Compare the costs and choose the option with the minimum cost\nsolution = min(cost_dh, cost_tom)\n```\n\nIn this code, we first calculate the minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Dick and 4 pints from Harry (`cost_dh`). Next, we calculate the minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Tom today and the remaining pints from either Dick or Harry tomorrow (`cost_tomorrow` and `cost_today`, which are then summed to get `cost_tom`). Finally, we compare `cost_dh` and `cost_tom`, and assign the minimum cost to `solution`.\n\nNote that we use the `min()` function to find the minimum price per pint tomorrow when calculating `cost_tomorrow`. This is because Tom will buy the remaining pints from the seller with the lower price per pint tomorrow.", "code": "# Prices per pint\nprice_dick_today = 3.00\nprice_dick_tomorrow = 2.70\nprice_harry_today = 2.90\nprice_harry_tomorrow = 2.80\n\n# Thirst requirements\npints_today = 3\npints_tomorrow = 4\n\n# Minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Dick and 4 pints from Harry\ncost_dh = price_dick_today * 3 + price_harry_tomorrow * 4\n\n# Minimum cost of buying 3 pints from Tom today and the remaining pints from either Dick or Harry tomorrow\nremaining_pints_tomorrow = pints_tomorrow - 3\n\ncost_tomorrow = min(price_dick_tomorrow, price_harry_tomorrow) * remaining_pints_tomorrow\ncost_today = price_tom_today * 3\ncost_tom = cost_today + cost_tomorrow\n\n# Compare the costs and choose the option with the minimum cost\nsolution = min(cost_dh, cost_tom)", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
