The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! First, let's analyze the problem. We have to minimize the cost for renting cars for 4 weeks. We are given that Luxor Travel has different numbers of rental cars for each week: 7 cars in the first and third week, 4 cars in the second week, and 8 cars in the fourth week. The rental fee is $220 per car per week, and there is a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction.\n\nWe can apply dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. Let's define our state as the number of cars rented for a specific week. The cost of keeping 'n' cars from week 'i' to week 'i+1' is:\n\ncost(n, i) = min(cost(n - k, i + 1) + k * 220 + 500) for k in range(0, n + 1)\n\nThe base case for our recursive function would be the last week (week 4) where there are 8 cars rented:\n\ncost(8, 3) = 8 \\* 220 = 1760\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost for the previous weeks using the recursive formula:\n\ncost(n, i) = min(cost(n - k, i + 1) + k \\* 220 + 500) for k in range(0, n + 1)\n\nFor the first week, we have 7 cars and the minimum cost is:\n\ncost(7, 0) = min(cost(7 - k, 1) + k \\* 220 + 500) for k in range(0, 7 + 1)\n\nHere's the Python code that calculates the minimal cost:\n\n```python\ndef min_cost(n_cars, weeks):\n    def cost(n, i):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if (n, i) in memo:\n            return memo[(n, i)]\n\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for k in range(n):\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost(n - k, i + 1) + k * 220 + 500)\n\n        memo[(n, i)] = min_cost\n        return min_cost\n\n    memo = {}\n    \n    for i in range(len(weeks) - 1, -1, -1):\n        n = weeks[i]\n        cost(n, i)\n\n    return cost(weeks[0], 0)\n\nweeks = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nsolution = min_cost(weeks, range(len(weeks)))\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable will contain the minimal cost for handling the rental situation and customer demand over the 4-week period.", "code": "def min_cost(n_cars, weeks):\n    def cost(n, i):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if (n, i) in memo:\n            return memo[(n, i)]\n\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for k in range(n):\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost(n - k, i + 1) + k * 220 + 500)\n\n        memo[(n, i)] = min_cost\n        return min_cost\n\n    memo = {}\n    \n    for i in range(len(weeks) - 1, -1, -1):\n        n = weeks[i]\n        cost(n, i)\n\n    return cost(weeks[0], 0)\n\nweeks = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nsolution = min_cost(weeks, range(len(weeks)))\nprint(solution)", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
