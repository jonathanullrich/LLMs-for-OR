Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's do that!\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected return and variance of a portfolio consisting of two stocks. The expected return of the portfolio is given by:\n\nexpected return = w1 \\* expected return of stock 1 + w2 \\* expected return of stock 2\n\nwhere w1 and w2 are the weights of the two stocks in the portfolio, and the expected return of stock 1 is 5 and the expected return of stock 2 is 10.\n\nThe variance of the portfolio is given by:\n\nvariance = w1^2 \\* variance of stock 1 + w2^2 \\* variance of stock 2 + 2 \\* w1 \\* w2 \\* covariance\n\nwhere the variance of stock 1 is 4, the variance of stock 2 is 100, and the covariance is 5.\n\nNow, we want to find the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent. This means we need to solve the following equation:\n\n0.15 = w1 \\* 5 + w2 \\* 10\n\nWe also have the constraint that w1 + w2 = 1, since the weights must sum to 1.\n\nSolving the first equation for w1, we get:\n\nw1 = (0.15 - w2 \\* 10) / 5\n\nSubstituting this expression for w1 into the second equation, we get:\n\n(0.15 - w2 \\* 10) / 5 + w2 = 1\n\nSolving for w2, we get:\n\nw2 = 0.05\n\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for w1, we get:\n\nw1 = 0.95\n\nTherefore, the solution is to invest 95% of Ann's money in stock 1 and 5% in stock 2.\n\nTo find the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent, we can multiply the weight of stock 1 by the amount of money Ann has to invest:\n\nminimum investment = w1 \\* $50,000\n\nSo the final solution is:\n\nsolution = w1 \\* $50,000 = 0.95 \\* $50,000 = $47,500\n\nTherefore, Ann has to invest a minimum of $47,500 to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
