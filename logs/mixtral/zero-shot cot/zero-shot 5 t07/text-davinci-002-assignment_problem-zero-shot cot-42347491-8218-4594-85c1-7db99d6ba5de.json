Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem systematically. We want to minimize the sum of the best times for the four strokes, so we need to find the optimal assignment of swimmers to strokes. This is a classic assignment problem, which can be solved using linear programming or combinatorial optimization techniques, such as the Hungarian algorithm.\n\nFirst, let's create a 2D array to represent the times for each swimmer and stroke. Then, we can apply the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment. I will use the `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` function to implement the Hungarian algorithm.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# Inputs\nbackstroke = [37.7, 32.9, 33.8, 37.0, 35.4]\nbreaststroke = [43.4, 33.1, 42.2, 34.7, 41.8]\nbutterfly = [33.3, 28.5, 38.9, 30.4, 33.6]\nfreestyle = [29.2, 26.4, 29.6, 28.5, 31.1]\n\n# Combine all times into a single array\ntimes = np.array([backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle])\n\n# Solve the assignment problem\nrow_indices, col_indices = linear_sum_assignment(times)\n\n# Calculate the minimum time\nmin_time = np.sum(times[row_indices, col_indices])\n\n# Assign the output\nsolution = min_time\n```\n\nNow the optimal time for the relay team is assigned to the variable `solution`.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# Inputs\nbackstroke = [37.7, 32.9, 33.8, 37.0, 35.4]\nbreaststroke = [43.4, 33.1, 42.2, 34.7, 41.8]\nbutterfly = [33.3, 28.5, 38.9, 30.4, 33.6]\nfreestyle = [29.2, 26.4, 29.6, 28.5, 31.1]\n\n# Combine all times into a single array\ntimes = np.array([backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle])\n\n# Solve the assignment problem\nrow_indices, col_indices = linear_sum_assignment(times)\n\n# Calculate the minimum time\nmin_time = np.sum(times[row_indices, col_indices])\n\n# Assign the output\nsolution = min_time", "solution": 126.2}
