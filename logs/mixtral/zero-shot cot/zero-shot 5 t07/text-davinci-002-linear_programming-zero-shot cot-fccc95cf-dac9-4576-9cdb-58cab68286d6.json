{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's first define the decision variables x1 and x2 as the number of units of product 1 and 2 to produce, respectively. The objective function to maximize is then:\n\nprofit = 1*x1 + 2*x2 (up to 60 units of product 2)\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\n1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (frame parts)\n2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (electrical components)\nx1, x2 >= 0\nx2 <= 60\n\nWe will use the Python package pulp to solve the linear programming problem.\n\nHere is the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the decision variables\nx1 = pulp.LpVariable('x1', lowBound=0, cat='Integer')\nx2 = pulp.LpVariable('x2', lowBound=0, upBound=60, cat='Integer')\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob = pulp.LpProblem('WorldLight Company Problem', pulp.LpMaximize)\nprob += 1*x1 + 2*x2\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += 1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200\nprob += 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nThe final output of the code is the variable `solution`, which contains the total profit.
