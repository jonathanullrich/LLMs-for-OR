Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's first determine the total profit function, which is the sum of the profit functions of both products. The production rate of Product 1 is R1 and of Product 2 is R2, and they both share the same production facilities with a total production limit of 2 units per hour.\n\nThe profit function for Product 1 is:\n\nP1(R1) = 200\\*R1 - 100\\*R1^2\n\nThe profit function for Product 2 is:\n\nP2(R2) = 300\\*R2 - 100\\*R2^2\n\nSince the total production rate cannot exceed 2 units per hour, we have the constraint: R1 + R2 <= 2\n\nNow, the total profit function would be:\n\nP(R1, R2) = P1(R1) + P2(R2) = 200\\*R1 - 100\\*R1^2 + 300\\*R2 - 100\\*R2^2\n\nWe need to find the optimal production rates (R1, R2) that maximize the total profit function P(R1, R2) while satisfying the production constraint.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem using the sympy library:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Derivative, Max, diff, solve, Min\n\nR1, R2 = symbols('R1 R2')\n\nP = 200*R1 - 100*R1**2 + 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\nconstraint = R1 + R2 - 2\n\nsol = solve([constraint, diff(P, R1), diff(P, R2)], (R1, R2))\n\nsolution = P.subs(sol)\n```\n\nThe variable `solution` holds the maximum total profit value after evaluating the total profit function P at the optimal production rates (R1, R2).", "code": "from sympy import symbols, Derivative, Max, diff, solve, Min\n\nR1, R2 = symbols('R1 R2')\n\nP = 200*R1 - 100*R1**2 + 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\nconstraint = R1 + R2 - 2\n\nsol = solve([constraint, diff(P, R1), diff(P, R2)], (R1, R2))\n\nsolution = P.subs(sol)", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
