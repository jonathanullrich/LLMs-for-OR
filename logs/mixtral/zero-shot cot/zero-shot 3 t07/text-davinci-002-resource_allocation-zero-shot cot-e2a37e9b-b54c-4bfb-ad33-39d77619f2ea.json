The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem systematically.\n\n1. We need to minimize the cost of renting cars for 4 weeks, given the fluctuating demand and the rental fees.\n2. We have two options for each week: rent the required number of cars for that week only or rent the cars for an additional week even if we don't need them in the current week.\n3. To minimize the cost, we should only rent cars for an additional week if it's beneficial or if we need them in the following week.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to solve this problem.\n\n```python\ndef min_cost(demand):\n    weeks = len(demand)\n    total_cost = 0\n\n    # Initialize the car count for each week\n    cars_needed = [0] + list(demand)\n\n    for week in range(1, weeks + 1):\n        # If there is no demand for this week and the previous week, return the cars\n        if cars_needed[week] == 0 and cars_needed[week - 1] == 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Rent cars based on the minimum of the current demand and cars available from the previous week\n        cars_rented = min(cars_needed[week], cars_needed[week - 1])\n\n        # Calculate the cost for this week\n        cost_this_week = cars_rented * 220 + 500\n\n        # Update the cars needed for the next week\n        cars_needed[week + 1] -= cars_rented\n        cars_needed[week] -= (cars_rented - cars_needed[week - 1])\n\n        total_cost += cost_this_week\n\n    return total_cost\n\n# Define demand as a list\ndemand = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Run the function\nsolution = min_cost(demand)\n```\n\nHere, the variable 'solution' will contain the minimum cost for renting cars according to the given demand and the rental fees.", "code": "def min_cost(demand):\n    weeks = len(demand)\n    total_cost = 0\n\n    # Initialize the car count for each week\n    cars_needed = [0] + list(demand)\n\n    for week in range(1, weeks + 1):\n        # If there is no demand for this week and the previous week, return the cars\n        if cars_needed[week] == 0 and cars_needed[week - 1] == 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Rent cars based on the minimum of the current demand and cars available from the previous week\n        cars_rented = min(cars_needed[week], cars_needed[week - 1])\n\n        # Calculate the cost for this week\n        cost_this_week = cars_rented * 220 + 500\n\n        # Update the cars needed for the next week\n        cars_needed[week + 1] -= cars_rented\n        cars_needed[week] -= (cars_rented - cars_needed[week - 1])\n\n        total_cost += cost_this_week\n\n    return total_cost\n\n# Define demand as a list\ndemand = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Run the function\nsolution = min_cost(demand)", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
