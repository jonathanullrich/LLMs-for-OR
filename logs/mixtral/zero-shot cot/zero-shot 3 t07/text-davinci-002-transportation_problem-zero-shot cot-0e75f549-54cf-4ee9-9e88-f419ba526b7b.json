Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the minimum cost per pint for each supplier.\n\n* Dick's minimum cost per pint today is $3.00 and tomorrow is $2.70. Therefore, the minimum cost per pint is $2.70 (tomorrow's price).\n* Harry's minimum cost per pint today is $2.90 and tomorrow is $2.80. Therefore, the minimum cost per pint is $2.80 (tomorrow's price).\n\nStep 2: Check which supplier offers the minimum cost per pint.\n\n* Dick offers a lower minimum cost per pint than Harry.\n\nStep 3: Check how many pints Tom can buy from Dick to minimize his cost.\n\n* Tom wants 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow, which totals to 7 pints.\n* Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints.\n* Therefore, Tom can buy 3 pints today (at $3.00 per pint) and 2 pints tomorrow (at $2.70 per pint), which totals to 5 pints and costs $13.70.\n\nStep 4: Check if there are any remaining pints that Tom needs to buy from Harry.\n\n* Tom still needs 2 more pints to satisfy his thirst requirements.\n* Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints.\n* Therefore, Tom can buy the remaining 2 pints from Harry tomorrow (at $2.80 per pint), which costs $5.60.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total cost of Tom's purchases.\n\n* The total cost of buying from Dick is $13.70.\n* The total cost of buying from Harry is $5.60.\n* Therefore, the total cost of Tom's purchases is $13.70 + $5.60 = $19.30.\n\nSo, the final output of the program should be:\n\nsolution = 19.30\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\n# Define the number of pints Tom wants today and tomorrow\ntoms_pints_today = 3\ntoms_pints_tomorrow = 4\n\n# Define the maximum number of pints each supplier is willing to sell, and the price per pint\ndicks_pints = 5\ndicks_price_today = 3.00\ndicks_price_tomorrow = 2.70\nharrys_pints = 4\nharrys_price_today = 2.90\nharrys_price_tomorrow = 2.80\n\n# Calculate the minimum cost per pint for each supplier\ndicks_min_price = min(dicks_price_today, dicks_price_tomorrow)\nharrys_min_price = min(harrys_price_today, harrys_price_tomorrow)\n\n# Check which supplier offers the minimum cost per pint\nif dicks_min_price < harrys_min_price:\n    #
