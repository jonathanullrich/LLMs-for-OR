Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure! To solve this problem, we'll first need to determine the optimal allocation of funds between the two stocks to achieve the desired return of 15%. We'll use the Modern Portfolio Theory to find the optimal allocation that minimizes the portfolio variance for a given expected return.\n\nLet's define our variables:\n\n* x1: number of 1,000-dollar units of Stock 1\n* x2: number of 1,000-dollar units of Stock 2\n* R1: expected return per block of Stock 1 (5%)\n* R2: expected return per block of Stock 2 (10%)\n* \u03c31^2: variance of the return on each block of Stock 1 (4)\n* \u03c32^2: variance of the return on each block of Stock 2 (100)\n* \u03c312: covariance of the returns on one block each of the two stocks (5)\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio (Rp) is calculated as:\n\nRp = x1 \\* R1 + x2 \\* R2\n\nThe variance of the portfolio (\u03c3p^2) is calculated as:\n\n\u03c3p^2 = x1^2 \\* \u03c31^2 + x2^2 \\* \u03c32^2 + 2 \\* x1 \\* x2 \\* \u03c312\n\nNow we need to solve this optimization problem using the constraints given:\n\n1. Ann has $50,000 to invest, so:\n\n2,000 \\* x1 + 3,000 \\* x2 = 50,000\n\n2. The target expected return is 15%, so:\n\nx1 \\* R1 + x2 \\* R2 = 0.15\n\nNow we can write the optimization problem as follows:\n\nminimize \u03c3p^2\n\nsubject to:\n\n2,000 \\* x1 + 3,000 \\* x2 = 50,000\n\nx1 \\* R1 + x2 \\* R2 = 0.15\n\nx1 >= 0\n\nx2 >= 0\n\nWe can solve this problem using a Python library such as `scipy.optimize`. Let's write the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# define the optimization problem\ndef calc_portfolio_variance(x, R1, R2, \u03c31_sq, \u03c32_sq, \u03c312):\n    return x[0]**2 * \u03c31_sq + x[1]**2 * \u03c32_sq + 2 * x[0] * x[1] * \u03c312\n\ndef calc_portfolio_return(x, R1, R2):\n    return x[0] * R1 + x[1] * R2\n\ndef calc_constraint(x):\n    return 2000 * x[0] + 3000 * x[1] - 50000\n\nR1 = 0.05\nR2 = 0.10\n\u03c31_sq = 4\n\u03c32_sq = 100\n\u03c312 = 5\n\nx0 = np.array([10, 10]) # initial guess\n\nconstraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': calc_constraint})\n\n# solve the optimization problem\nresult = minimize(calc_portfolio_variance, x0, args=(R1, R2, \u03c31_sq, \u03c32_sq, \u03c312), method='SLSQP', bounds=[(0, None), (0, None)], constraints=constraints)\n\n# calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent\nsolution = calc_portfolio_return(result.x, R1, R2) * 1000\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define the functions to calculate the portfolio variance, expected return, and constraint. Then, we define the optimization problem using `scipy.optimize.minimize` and solve it with the given constraints. Finally, we calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.\n\nThe output of this code is the value of the solution variable, which represents the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# define the optimization problem\ndef calc_portfolio_variance(x, R1, R2, \u03c31_sq, \u03c32_sq, \u03c312):\n    return x[0]**2 * \u03c31_sq + x[1]**2 * \u03c32_sq + 2 * x[0] * x[1] * \u03c312\n\ndef calc_portfolio_return(x, R1, R2):\n    return x[0] * R1 + x[1] * R2\n\ndef calc_constraint(x):\n    return 2000 * x[0] + 3000 * x[1] - 50000\n\nR1 = 0.05\nR2 = 0.10\n\u03c31_sq = 4\n\u03c32_sq = 100\n\u03c312 = 5\n\nx0 = np.array([10, 10]) # initial guess\n\nconstraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': calc_constraint})\n\n# solve the optimization problem\nresult = minimize(calc_portfolio_variance, x0, args=(R1, R2, \u03c31_sq, \u03c32_sq, \u03c312), method='SLSQP', bounds=[(0, None), (0, None)], constraints=constraints)\n\n# calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent\nsolution = calc_portfolio_return(result.x, R1, R2) * 1000", "solution": 1256.6489367587176}
