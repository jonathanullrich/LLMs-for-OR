Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's first determine the total profit function from both products.\n\nThe profit per hour from Product 1 is given by:\nP1 = 200\\*R1 - 100\\*R1^2\n\nThe profit per hour from Product 2 is given by:\nP2 = 300\\*R2 - 100\\*R2^2\n\nSince the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour, we have:\nR1 + R2 \u2264 2\n\nThe total profit per hour from both products is given by:\nP = P1 + P2\nP = 200\\*R1 - 100\\*R1^2 + 300\\*R2 - 100\\*R2^2\n\nTo find the optimal product mix that maximizes the total profit, we need to optimize the total profit function P with respect to R1 and R2 subject to the constraint R1 + R2 \u2264 2.\n\nWe can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this optimization problem.\n\nLet's define the Lagrangian function:\nL = P - \u03bb(R1 + R2 - 2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nWe need to find the values of R1, R2, and \u03bb that maximize the Lagrangian function subject to the constraint.\n\nThe gradient of L with respect to R1, R2, and \u03bb is:\n\u2207L = [200 - 200\\*R1 - \u03bb, 300 - 200\\*R2 - \u03bb, R1 + R2 - 2]\n\nSetting the gradient to zero, we get:\n200 - 200\\*R1 - \u03bb = 0\n300 - 200\\*R2 - \u03bb = 0\nR1 + R2 = 2\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get:\nR1 = 1 - 0.5\\*R2\n\u03bb = 100 - 100\\*R1 = 100 - 50\\*R2\n\nSubstituting R1 and \u03bb back into the total profit function P, we get:\nP = 200\\*(1 - 0.5\\*R2) - 100\\*(1 - 0.5\\*R2)^2 + 300\\*R2 - 100\\*R2^2\n\nTo find the optimal value of R2 that maximizes the total profit, we can take the derivative of P with respect to R2 and set it to zero:\ndP/dR2 = 0\n\nSolving for R2, we get:\nR2 = 0.5\n\nSubstituting R2 back into the equation for R1, we get:\nR1 = 1 - 0.5\\*R2 = 0.75\n\nTherefore, the optimal product mix is to produce 0.75 units of Product 1 and 0.5 units of Product 2 per hour, which results in a total profit of:\nP = 200\\*0.75 - 100\\*0.75^2 + 300\\*0.5 - 100\\*0.5^2 = $262.50 per hour\n\nSo, the variable 'solution' would be assigned to 262.50.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
