{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem first. We need to find the best combination of participating in one or both of the ventures to maximize the total estimated profit. We are given the following information:\n\n1. Your own investment of $12,000.\n2. The required investment, time commitment, and estimated profit for each friend's venture for a full partnership.\n3. Both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership.\n4. The maximum time you can commit is 600 hours.\n5. The goal is to maximize the total estimated profit.\n\nLet's denote the fraction of a full partnership for friend 1 as x and the fraction of a full partnership for friend 2 as y.
