Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem step by step.\n\n1. We need to identify the minimum number of unique groups of employees that can be formed based on the projects they work on.\n2. We can create a set of employees working on each project and then find the union of those sets.\n3. After finding the union of sets, we can calculate its size to find the minimum number of employees that need to attend group meetings.\n4. Here's the Python code for solving the problem:\n\n```python\n# Employees working on each project\nemp_on_proj = {\n    1: [2, 5, 6, 7, 10],\n    2: [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10],\n    3: [2, 4, 6, 8],\n    4: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8],\n    5: [1, 2, 4, 9, 10],\n    6: [3, 5, 6, 9],\n}\n\n# Union of sets of employees working on each project\nemployee_union = set().union(*emp_on_proj.values())\n\n# Assign the solution variable\nsolution = len(employee_union)\n```\n\nThe solution variable contains the minimum number of employees that need to attend group meetings.", "code": "# Employees working on each project\nemp_on_proj = {\n    1: [2, 5, 6, 7, 10],\n    2: [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10],\n    3: [2, 4, 6, 8],\n    4: [3, 4, 5, 6, 8],\n    5: [1, 2, 4, 9, 10],\n    6: [3, 5, 6, 9],\n}\n\n# Union of sets of employees working on each project\nemployee_union = set().union(*emp_on_proj.values())\n\n# Assign the solution variable\nsolution = len(employee_union)", "solution": 10}
