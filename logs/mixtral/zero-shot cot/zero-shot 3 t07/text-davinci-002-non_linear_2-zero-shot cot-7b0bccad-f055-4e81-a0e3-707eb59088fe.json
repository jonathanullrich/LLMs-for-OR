The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield.
