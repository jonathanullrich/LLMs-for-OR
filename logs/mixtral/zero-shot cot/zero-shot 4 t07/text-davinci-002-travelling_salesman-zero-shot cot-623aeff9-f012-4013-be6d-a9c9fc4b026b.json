Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": " First, we need to determine which employees are working on each project. We can do this by creating a dictionary where the keys are the project numbers, and the values are sets of employees working on each project.\n\nNext, we can determine the minimum number of meetings required to discuss each project. This can be done by finding the maximum cardinality of the sets of employees working on each project, which will require all employees working on that project to be present in a single meeting.\n\nThen, we can sort the projects in descending order of the number of employees working on each project and schedule meetings accordingly. We start with the project with the maximum number of employees and schedule a meeting for all of them. For the following projects, we check if any of the employees already have a meeting scheduled. If not, we add them to the previous meeting. Otherwise, we schedule a new meeting for them.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Define the employees working on each project\nprojects = {\n    1: {1, 2, 5, 6, 10},\n    2: {1, 2, 3, 5, 10},\n    3: {2, 3, 4, 6},\n    4: {1, 3, 4, 6, 10},\n    5: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7},\n    6: {3, 6, 7, 9, 10},\n}\n\n# Determine the minimum number of meetings required\nnum_meetings = max(len(employees) for employees in projects.values())\n\n# Sort the projects in descending order of the number of employees working on each project\nsorted_projects = sorted(projects.items(), key=lambda x: len(x[1]), reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the meetings with the first project\nmeetings = {0: sorted_projects[0][1]}\n\n# Schedule the remaining projects\nfor project, employees in sorted_projects[1:]:\n    # Find the meeting with the least overlap with the new project\n    min_overlap = num_meetings + 1\n    min_meeting = None\n    for meeting in meetings.values():\n        overlap = len(employees.intersection(meeting))\n        if overlap < min_overlap:\n            min_overlap = overlap\n            min_meeting = meeting\n\n    # If there is no overlap, add the new project to the meeting\n    if min_overlap == 0:\n        meetings[len(meetings)] = min_meeting.union(employees)\n    # If there is overlap, schedule a new meeting for the project\n    else:\n        meetings[len(meetings)] = employees\n\n# Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\nmin_traffic = max(len(meeting) for meeting in meetings.values())\nsolution = min_traffic\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable will contain the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "code": "# Define the employees working on each project\nprojects = {\n    1: {1, 2, 5, 6, 10},\n    2: {1, 2, 3, 5, 10},\n    3: {2, 3, 4, 6},\n    4: {1, 3, 4, 6, 10},\n    5: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7},\n    6: {3, 6, 7, 9, 10},\n}\n\n# Determine the minimum number of meetings required\nnum_meetings = max(len(employees) for employees in projects.values())\n\n# Sort the projects in descending order of the number of employees working on each project\nsorted_projects = sorted(projects.items(), key=lambda x: len(x[1]), reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the meetings with the first project\nmeetings = {0: sorted_projects[0][1]}\n\n# Schedule the remaining projects\nfor project, employees in sorted_projects[1:]:\n    # Find the meeting with the least overlap with the new project\n    min_overlap = num_meetings + 1\n    min_meeting = None\n    for meeting in meetings.values():\n        overlap = len(employees.intersection(meeting))\n        if overlap < min_overlap:\n            min_overlap = overlap\n            min_meeting = meeting\n\n    # If there is no overlap, add the new project to the meeting\n    if min_overlap == 0:\n        meetings[len(meetings)] = min_meeting.union(employees)\n    # If there is overlap, schedule a new meeting for the project\n    else:\n        meetings[len(meetings)] = employees\n\n# Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\nmin_traffic = max(len(meeting) for meeting in meetings.values())\nsolution = min_traffic", "solution": 5}
