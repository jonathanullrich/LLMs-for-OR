Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem. The objective is to determine the best product mix for two new products (Product 1 and Product 2) in order to maximize the total profit per hour. The production rate of the two products combined cannot exceed two units per hour. The profit functions for the two products are as follows:\n\nProduct 1 profit = $200*R1 - $100*R1^2\nProduct 2 profit = $300*R2 - $100*R2^2\n\nWhere R1 is the production rate of Product 1 and R2 is the production rate of Product 2.\n\nWe want to find the optimal values for R1 and R2 that maximize the total profit, subject to the constraint that R1 + R2 \u2264 2.\n\nFirst, let's write a function for the profit of Product 1.\n\ndef product1\\_profit(r1):\nreturn 200*r1 - 100*r1**2\n\nNext, let's write a function for the profit of Product 2.\n\ndef product2\\_profit(r2):\nreturn 300*r2 - 100*r2**2\n\nNow, let's define a function for the total profit of the two products, subject to the constraint that R1 + R2 \u2264 2.\n\ndef total\\_profit(r1, r2):\nif r1 + r2 <= 2:\nreturn product1\\_profit(r1) + product2\\_profit(r2)\nelse:\nreturn float('-inf')\n\nFinally, we can use the `maximize` function from the `scipy.optimize` library to find the optimal values for R1 and R2 that maximize the total profit.\n\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\nresult = minimize(total\\_profit, (0, 0), method='SLSQP', bounds=[(0, 2), (0, 2)])\n\nr1\\_opt = result.x[0]\nr2\\_opt = result.x[1]\n\nsolution = total\\_profit(r1\\_opt, r2\\_opt)\n\nSo the final output, which is the maximum total profit, is stored in the variable `solution`.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
