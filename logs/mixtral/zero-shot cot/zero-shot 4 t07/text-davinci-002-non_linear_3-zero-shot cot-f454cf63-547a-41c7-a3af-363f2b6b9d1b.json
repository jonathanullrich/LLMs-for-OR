Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's first define the decision variables, which will be the number of blocks of each stock to purchase.\n\nx1 = number of blocks of Stock 1\nx2 = number of blocks of Stock 2\n\nThe return on investment (ROI) is given as 15%, so we need to find the amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a ROI of 15%. We can set up the following equation:\n\n(5 * x1 + 10 * x2) / (20 * x1 + 30 * x2) = 0.15\n\nWe can simplify this equation to:\n\n5 * x1 + 10 * x2 = 3 * (20 * x1 + 30 * x2)\n\nSolving for x2 in terms of x1, we get:\n\nx2 = (5/60) * x1\n\nNow we need to find the minimum value of x1 such that x1 and x2 are integers and the variance of the portfolio is minimized. We can calculate the variance of the portfolio using the formula:\n\nVariance = w1^2 * Variance1 + w2^2 * Variance2 + 2*w1*w2*Covariance\n\nwhere w1 and w2 are the weights (proportions) of the two stocks in the portfolio and Covariance is the covariance of the returns of the two stocks.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nVariance = (x1^2 / (x1 + x2)^2) * 4 + (x2^2 / (x1 + x2)^2) * 100 + 2 * (x1 / (x1 + x2)) * (x2 / (x1 + x2)) * 5\n\nSubstituting x2 = (5/60) * x1 and simplifying, we get:\n\nVariance = (119/3600) * x1^2 + (25/288) * x1\n\nSince Ann is risk-averse, we want to minimize the variance of the portfolio. We can find the minimum value of x1 that satisfies the equation 5 * x1 + 10 * x2 = 0.45 * (20 * x1 + 30 * x2) and has an integer value for both x1 and x2.\n\nWe can start from x1 = 1 and keep increasing it by 1 until we find a value that satisfies the equation and has an integer value for x2. We find that for x1 = 12, we get x2 = 10/6, which is not an integer. However, for x1 = 13, we get x2 = 10/6.3, which can be rounded up to 2 without significantly affecting the variance of the portfolio.\n\nTherefore, we will choose x1 = 13 and x2 = 2. The minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest is:\n\n13 * 20 + 2 * 30 = 260 + 60 = 320\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\nsolution = 320", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
