The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem and then I can write Python code to solve it.\n\nWe are given four jobs with processing times and deadlines. Our goal is to minimize the time needed to process all the jobs while satisfying their respective deadlines.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm approach by scheduling the jobs with the earliest deadlines first. Here's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_processing_time(job_processing_times, job_deadlines):\n    jobs = sorted(zip(job_processing_times, job_deadlines), key=lambda x: x[1])\n    completion_times = [0]\n    for job_processing_time, job_deadline in jobs:\n        completion_time = max(completion_times[-1] + job_processing_time, job_deadline)\n        completion_times.append(completion_time)\n    return completion_times[-1]\n\njob_processing_times = [6, 4, 5, 8]\njob_deadlines = [8, 4, 12, 16]\nsolution = min_processing_time(job_processing_times, job_deadlines)\n```\n\nIn this code, we first sort the jobs by their deadlines. Then, we process each job in order of their deadlines, keeping track of the completion times. The final completion time is the minimal processing time.", "code": "def min_processing_time(job_processing_times, job_deadlines):\n    jobs = sorted(zip(job_processing_times, job_deadlines), key=lambda x: x[1])\n    completion_times = [0]\n    for job_processing_time, job_deadline in jobs:\n        completion_time = max(completion_times[-1] + job_processing_time, job_deadline)\n        completion_times.append(completion_time)\n    return completion_times[-1]\n\njob_processing_times = [6, 4, 5, 8]\njob_deadlines = [8, 4, 12, 16]\nsolution = min_processing_time(job_processing_times, job_deadlines)", "solution": 23}
