Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem and identify the decision variables and objective function.\n\nWe have two suppliers, Dick and Harry, from whom Tom can purchase home brew. Tom's demand is 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow. The price of home brew varies by supplier and day. Dick charges $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow, while Harry charges $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Our goal is to minimize Tom's total cost while meeting his demand.\n\nWe can define decision variables as follows:\n\n* x1: pints purchased from Dick today\n* x2: pints purchased from Dick tomorrow\n* y1: pints purchased from Harry today\n* y2: pints purchased from Harry tomorrow\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n* x1 + x2 = 3 (demand for pints from Dick)\n* y1 + y2 = 4 (demand for pints from Harry)\n* x1, x2, y1, y2 \u2265 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to minimize is:\n\n3x1 + 2.7x2 + 2.9y1 + 2.8y2\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the decision variables\nprob = pulp.LpProblem('Home Brew Problem', pulp.LpMinimize)\nx1 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Dick today', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx2 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Dick tomorrow', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny1 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Harry today', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny2 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Harry tomorrow', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob += 3*x1 + 2.7*x2 + 2.9*y1 + 2.8*y2, 'Total cost'\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += x1 + x2 == 3\nprob += y1 + y2 == 4\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' contains the minimum total cost for Tom to satisfy his demand.", "code": "import pulp\n\n# Define the decision variables\nprob = pulp.LpProblem('Home Brew Problem', pulp.LpMinimize)\nx1 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Dick today', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx2 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Dick tomorrow', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny1 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Harry today', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny2 = pulp.LpVariable('Pints from Harry tomorrow', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob += 3*x1 + 2.7*x2 + 2.9*y1 + 2.8*y2, 'Total cost'\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += x1 + x2 == 3\nprob += y1 + y2 == 4\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)", "solution": 19.3}
