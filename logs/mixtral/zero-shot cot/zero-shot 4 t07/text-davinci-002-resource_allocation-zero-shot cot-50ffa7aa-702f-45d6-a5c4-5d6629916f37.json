The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem and identify the decision variables, objective, and constraints.\n\nDecision variables:\n\n* Let x\\_i denote the number of cars rented in week i, where i = 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nObjective:\n\n* Minimize the total cost, which is given by:\n\nT\n\notal Cost = $500 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4) + $220 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)\n\nConstraints:\n\n* The total number of cars rented in each week must be less than or equal to the number of cars available in that week.\n\nx1 <= 7\n\nx2 <= 4\n\nx3 <= 7\n\nx4 <= 8\n\n* The total number of cars rented over the 4-week period must meet the customer demand.\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 + x4 >= 7\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to solve this problem using the above information.\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Create a linear programming problem\nprob = pulp.LpProblem('Luxor Travel', pulp.LpMinimize)\n\n# Define the decision variables\ncars\\_per\\_week = {1: 7, 2: 4, 3: 7, 4: 8}\nx = pulp.LpVariable.dicts('Rented Cars', range(1, 5), cat='Integer', lowBound=0)\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob += 500 * sum(x[i] for i in range(1, 5)) + 220 * sum(x[i] for i in range(1, 5)), 'Total Cost'\n\n# Define the constraints\nfor i in range(1, 5):\n    prob += x[i] <= cars\\_per\\_week[i]\n\nprob += sum(x[i] for i in range(1, 5)) >= 7\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Get the solution\nsolution = pulp.LpStatus[prob.status]\n\nprint(f'Status: {solution}')\nprint(f'Total Cost: ${pulp.value(prob.objective)}')\n```\n\nThe code creates a linear programming problem using the pulp library and solves it to find the optimal rental strategy.
