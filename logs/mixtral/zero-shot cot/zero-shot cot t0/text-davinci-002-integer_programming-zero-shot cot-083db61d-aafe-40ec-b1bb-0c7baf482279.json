Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem systematically. We want to minimize the total time spent on household chores by assigning two tasks to Eve and two tasks to Steven. We can represent this problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.\n\nFirst, let's define the decision variables:\n\n* x1: Eve does marketing\n* x2: Eve does cooking\n* x3: Eve does dishwashing\n* x4: Eve does laundering\n* y1: Steven does marketing\n* y2: Steven does cooking\n* y3: Steven does dishwashing\n* y4: Steven does laundering\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. Each task is assigned to exactly one person:\n\t* x1 + y1 = 1\n\t* x2 + y2 = 1\n\t* x3 + y3 = 1\n\t* x4 + y4 = 1\n2. Eve does two tasks, and Steven does two tasks:\n\t* x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 2\n\t* y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 = 2\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total time spent on household chores:\n\n* Minimize: 4.5x1 + 7.8x2 + 3.6x3 + 2.9x4 + 4.9y1 + 7.2y2 + 4.3y3 + 3.1y4\n\nNow, let's write the code using Python and the PuLP library to solve the ILP problem:\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the problem\nprob = pulp.LpProblem(\"HouseholdChores\", pulp.LpMinimize)\n\n# Define the decision variables\nx1 = pulp.LpVariable(\"x1\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\nx2 = pulp.LpVariable(\"x2\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\nx3 = pulp.LpVariable(\"x3\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\nx4 = pulp.LpVariable(\"x4\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\ny1 = pulp.LpVariable(\"y1\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\ny2 = pulp.LpVariable(\"y2\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\ny3 = pulp.LpVariable(\"y3\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\ny4 = pulp.LpVariable(\"y4\", 0, 1, cat=\"Binary\")\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob += 4.5 * x1 + 7.8 * x2 + 3.6 * x3 + 2.9 * x4 + 4.9 * y1 + 7.2 * y2 + 4.3 * y3 + 3.1 * y4\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += x1 + y1 == 1\nprob += x2 + y2 == 1\nprob += x3 + y3 == 1\nprob += x4 + y4 == 1\nprob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 == 2\nprob += y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 == 2\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Get the solution\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nThe code defines the problem, decision variables, objective function, and constraints.
