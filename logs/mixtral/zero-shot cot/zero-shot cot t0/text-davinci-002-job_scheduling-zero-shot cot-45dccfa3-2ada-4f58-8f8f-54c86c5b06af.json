We want to minimize the makespan (the time when all jobs are completed) while satisfying the given deadlines.\n3. This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm approach.\n4. Sort the jobs in decreasing order of their deadlines.\n5. For each job, if it can be started immediately without violating any deadlines, schedule it.\n6. Update the earliest available time for the next job.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code for the above approach.\n\n```python\ndef min_time_to_process_jobs(jobs, deadlines):\n    # Sort jobs by deadlines in descending order\n    jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Initialize the earliest available time\n    earlest_start_time = 0\n\n    # Process jobs one by one\n    for job, deadline in jobs:\n        # If the job can be started immediately\n        if earlest_start_time <= deadline - job:\n            earlest_start_time += job\n        # If the job cannot be started immediately, skip it\n        else:\n            job_to_skip = job + earlest_start_time - deadline\n            earlest_start_time += job_to_skip\n\n    return earlest_start_time\n\njobs = [(6, 8), (4, 4), (5, 12), (8, 16)]\nsolution = min_time_to_process_jobs(jobs, [8, 4, 12, 16])\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' now contains the minimal time to process the jobs.", "code": "def min_time_to_process_jobs(jobs, deadlines):\n    # Sort jobs by deadlines in descending order\n    jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Initialize the earliest available time\n    earlest_start_time = 0\n\n    # Process jobs one by one\n    for job, deadline in jobs:\n        # If the job can be started immediately\n        if earlest_start_time <= deadline - job:\n            earlest_start_time += job\n        # If the job cannot be started immediately, skip it\n        else:\n            job_to_skip = job + earlest_start_time - deadline\n            earlest_start_time += job_to_skip\n\n    return earlest_start_time\n\njobs = [(6, 8), (4, 4), (5, 12), (8, 16)]\nsolution = min_time_to_process_jobs(jobs, [8, 4, 12, 16])", "solution": 32}
