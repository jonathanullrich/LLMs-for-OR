The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem and determine the steps required to solve it.\n\n1. We need to minimize the cost of renting cars for 4 weeks while meeting customer demand.\n2. The weekly rental fee is $220 per car, and there is a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction.\n3. Luxor Travel can keep the cars for an additional week by continuing to pay the weekly rent.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to minimize the cost of renting cars for 4 weeks. Here's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_cost(demand, weeks_remaining):\n    if weeks_remaining == 0:\n        return 0 if demand == 0 else float('inf')\n\n    if (demand, weeks_remaining) in memo:\n        return memo[(demand, weeks_remaining)]\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n    for num_cars in range(demand, -1, -1):\n        cost = 500 * num_cars + 220 * num_cars * weeks_remaining + min_cost(demand - num_cars, weeks_remaining - 1)\n        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)\n\n    memo[(demand, weeks_remaining)] = min_cost\n    return min_cost\n\n# Initialize memo dictionary\nmemo = {}\n\n# Define demand for each week\ndemand = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Calculate minimum cost\nsolution = min_cost(sum(demand), 4)\n```\n\nIn this code, `memo` is a dictionary used to store the minimum cost for each combination of `demand` and `weeks_remaining`. The `min_cost` function calculates the minimum cost of meeting the `demand` for the remaining `weeks_remaining`. The function uses recursion and memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nThe `solution` variable will contain the minimum cost of renting cars for 4 weeks while meeting customer demand.", "code": "def min_cost(demand, weeks_remaining):\n    if weeks_remaining == 0:\n        return 0 if demand == 0 else float('inf')\n\n    if (demand, weeks_remaining) in memo:\n        return memo[(demand, weeks_remaining)]\n\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n    for num_cars in range(demand, -1, -1):\n        cost = 500 * num_cars + 220 * num_cars * weeks_remaining + min_cost(demand - num_cars, weeks_remaining - 1)\n        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)\n\n    memo[(demand, weeks_remaining)] = min_cost\n    return min_cost\n\n# Initialize memo dictionary\nmemo = {}\n\n# Define demand for each week\ndemand = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Calculate minimum cost\nsolution = min_cost(sum(demand), 4)", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
