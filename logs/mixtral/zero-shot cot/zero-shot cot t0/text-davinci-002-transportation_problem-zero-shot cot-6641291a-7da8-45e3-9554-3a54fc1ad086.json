Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem and determine what we need to do to solve it.\n\n1. We need to minimize Tom's cost for purchasing 3 pints of home brew today and 4 pints of home brew tomorrow.\n2. We have two suppliers: Dick and Harry.\n3. Dick is willing to sell up to 5 pints total, with a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow.\n4. Harry is willing to sell up to 4 pints total, with a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow.\n\nTo minimize Tom's cost, we need to determine the optimal combination of pints to purchase from each supplier. We can set up a linear programming problem to solve this.\n\nLet x be the number of pints purchased from Dick today, and y be the number of pints purchased from Dick tomorrow. Similarly, let z be the number of pints purchased from Harry today, and w be the number of pints purchased from Harry tomorrow.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n* x + z = 3 (Tom needs 3 pints today)\n* y + w = 4 (Tom needs 4 pints tomorrow)\n* x + y <= 5 (Dick's limit)\n* z + w <= 4 (Harry's limit)\n* x, y, z, w >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nThe objective function to minimize is:\n\n* Cost = 3x + 2.7y + 2.9z + 2.8w\n\nWe can use the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function to solve this linear programming problem.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the objective function\nc = np.array([3, 2.7, 2.9, 2.8])\n\n# Define the constraints\nA_eq = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 0],\n                 [0, 1, 0, 1]])\nb_eq = np.array([3, 4])\n\nA_ub = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 1, 0],\n                 [1, 0, 0, 1],\n                 [0, 1, 1, 0]])\nb_ub = np.array([1, 4, 5, 4])\n\n# Define the bounds\nbounds = [(0, None), (0, None), (0, None), (0, None)]\n\n# Solve the linear programming problem\nresult = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, bounds=bounds, method='simplex',\n                  options={'presolve': True, 'exit': False})\n\n# Extract the solution\nsolution = sum(result.x[:2]) + sum(result.x[2:])\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable contains the minimum cost for Tom to satisfy his thirst requirements.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the objective function\nc = np.array([3, 2.7, 2.9, 2.8])\n\n# Define the constraints\nA_eq = np.array([[1, 0, 1, 0],\n                 [0, 1, 0, 1]])\nb_eq = np.array([3, 4])\n\nA_ub = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 1, 0],\n                 [1, 0, 0, 1],\n                 [0, 1, 1, 0]])\nb_ub = np.array([1, 4, 5, 4])\n\n# Define the bounds\nbounds = [(0, None), (0, None), (0, None), (0, None)]\n\n# Solve the linear programming problem\nresult = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, bounds=bounds, method='simplex',\n                  options={'presolve': True, 'exit': False})\n\n# Extract the solution\nsolution = sum(result.x[:2]) + sum(result.x[2:])", "solution": 0.0}
