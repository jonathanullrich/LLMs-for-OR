He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's break down the problem and come up with a step-by-step approach to solve it.\n\n1. We are given a set of streets connecting various points, with their respective lengths.\n2. Our goal is to find the shortest route that allows the postman to walk through each street at least once, starting and ending at point A.\n3. We can model this problem as a graph, where each point is a node, and each street is an edge with a weight corresponding to its length.\n4. The problem can be solved using the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) algorithm, which is a routing problem that seeks to find the shortest possible route that visits every edge of a graph at least once, starting and ending at the same vertex.\n5. The Chinese Postman Problem can be solved using an algorithm that involves finding the minimum-weight perfect matching in a graph.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef get_min_weight_matching(graph):\n    n = len(graph)\n    inf = float('inf')\n    matching = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if graph[i][j] != 0:\n                matching[i][j] = graph[i][j]\n                matching[j][i] = graph[i][j]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if matching[i][j] == 0:\n                for k in range(n):\n                    if matching[i][k] != 0 and matching[j][k] == 0:\n                        matching[j][k] = matching[i][k]\n                        matching[i][k] = 0\n                        break\n    min_weight = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if matching[i][j] != 0:\n                min_weight += matching[i][j]\n    return min_weight, matching\n\ndef solve_chinese_postman_problem(graph):\n    n = len(graph)\n    inf = float('inf')\n    total_weight = 0\n    odd_degree_nodes = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        degree = sum(graph[i])\n        if degree % 2 != 0:\n            odd_degree_nodes.append(i)\n    if len(odd_degree_nodes) > 0:\n        sub_graph = []\n        for i, j in itertools.combinations(odd_degree_nodes, 2):\n            sub_graph.append([graph[i][j], i, j])\n        min_weight, sub_graph = get_min_weight_matching(sub_graph)\n        total_weight += min_weight\n        for i, j, weight in sub_graph:\n            graph[i][j] = weight\n            graph[j][i] = weight\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if graph[i][j] != 0:\n                total_weight += graph[i][j]\n    return total_weight\n\ngraph = [\n    [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 0, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n]\n\nsolution = solve_chinese_postman_problem(graph)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable will contain the length of the shortest route that allows the postman to walk through each street at least once, starting and ending at point A.", "code": "import itertools\n\ndef get_min_weight_matching(graph):\n    n = len(graph)\n    inf = float('inf')\n    matching = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if graph[i][j] != 0:\n                matching[i][j] = graph[i][j]\n                matching[j][i] = graph[i][j]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if matching[i][j] == 0:\n                for k in range(n):\n                    if matching[i][k] != 0 and matching[j][k] == 0:\n                        matching[j][k] = matching[i][k]\n                        matching[i][k] = 0\n                        break\n    min_weight = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if matching[i][j] != 0:\n                min_weight += matching[i][j]\n    return min_weight, matching\n\ndef solve_chinese_postman_problem(graph):\n    n = len(graph)\n    inf = float('inf')\n    total_weight = 0\n    odd_degree_nodes = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        degree = sum(graph[i])\n        if degree % 2 != 0:\n            odd_degree_nodes.append(i)\n    if len(odd_degree_nodes) > 0:\n        sub_graph = []\n        for i, j in itertools.combinations(odd_degree_nodes, 2):\n            sub_graph.append([graph[i][j], i, j])\n        min_weight, sub_graph = get_min_weight_matching(sub_graph)\n        total_weight += min_weight\n        for i, j, weight in sub_graph:\n            graph[i][j] = weight\n            graph[j][i] = weight\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if graph[i][j] != 0:\n                total_weight += graph[i][j]\n    return total_weight\n\ngraph = [\n    [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9, 5, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 3, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 0, 3],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n]\n\nsolution = solve_chinese_postman_problem(graph)\nprint(solution)", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
