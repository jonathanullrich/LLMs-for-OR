Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem step by step.\n\n1. Define the objective function: We need to maximize the total profit, which can be expressed as:\n   f(x1, x2, x3) = 360*min(15, x1) + 30*(x1 - min(15, x1)) + 240*min(20, x2) + 120*(x2 - min(20, x2)) + 90\\*(x2 - min(40, x2)) + 450*min(20, x3) + 300\\*(x3 - min(20, x3)) + 180\\*(x3 - min(30, x3))\n2. Define the constraints: We have three constraints given in the problem:\n   g1(x1, x2, x3) = x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\n   g2(x1, x2, x3) = 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200\n   g3(x1, x2, x3) = x1 + 2*x3 <= 70\n3. Define the decision variables:\n   x1, x2, x3 >= 0\n\nNow, let's write the Python code using the PuLP library to solve this linear programming problem.\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the objective function\nprofit = pulp.LpProblem(name=\"Maximize_Profit\", sense=pulp.LpMaximize)\n\n# Define the decision variables\nx1 = pulp.LpVariable(name=\"x1\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx2 = pulp.LpVariable(name=\"x2\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx3 = pulp.LpVariable(name=\"x3\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Add the objective function to the problem\nprofit.objective = 360 * pulp.minimum(15, x1) + 30 * (x1 - pulp.minimum(15, x1)) + \\\n                   240 * pulp.minimum(20, x2) + 120 * (x2 - pulp.minimum(20, x2)) + \\\n                   90 * (x2 - pulp.minimum(40, x2)) + \\\n                   450 * pulp.minimum(20, x3) + 300 * (x3 - pulp.minimum(20, x3)) + \\\n                   180 * (x3 - pulp.minimum(30, x3))\n\n# Add the constraints to the problem\nprofit += x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\nprofit += 3 * x1 + 2 * x2 <= 200\nprofit += x1 + 2 * x3 <= 70\n\n# Solve the problem\nstatus = profit.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to the 'solution' variable\nsolution = status\n```\n\nThe 'solution' variable will contain the solution status of the problem. To get the optimal values of x1, x2, and x3, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nif solution == 1:  # Optimal solution found\n    print(f\"Optimal solution found:\\nx1 = {x1.varValue:.2f}\\nx2 = {x2.varValue:.2f}\\nx3 = {x3.varValue:.2f}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis will print the optimal values of x1, x2, and x3 if an optimal solution is found.", "code": "import pulp\n\n# Define the objective function\nprofit = pulp.LpProblem(name=\"Maximize_Profit\", sense=pulp.LpMaximize)\n\n# Define the decision variables\nx1 = pulp.LpVariable(name=\"x1\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx2 = pulp.LpVariable(name=\"x2\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx3 = pulp.LpVariable(name=\"x3\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Add the objective function to the problem\nprofit.objective = 360 * pulp.minimum(15, x1) + 30 * (x1 - pulp.minimum(15, x1)) + \\\n                   240 * pulp.minimum(20, x2) + 120 * (x2 - pulp.minimum(20, x2)) + \\\n                   90 * (x2 - pulp.minimum(40, x2)) + \\\n                   450 * pulp.minimum(20, x3) + 300 * (x3 - pulp.minimum(20, x3)) + \\\n                   180 * (x3 - pulp.minimum(30, x3))\n\n# Add the constraints to the problem\nprofit += x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\nprofit += 3 * x1 + 2 * x2 <= 200\nprofit += x1 + 2 * x3 <= 70\n\n# Solve the problem\nstatus = profit.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to the 'solution' variable\nsolution = status\nif solution == 1:  # Optimal solution found\n    print(f\"Optimal solution found:\\nx1 = {x1.varValue:.2f}\\nx2 = {x2.varValue:.2f}\\nx3 = {x3.varValue:.2f}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No optimal solution found.\")", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
