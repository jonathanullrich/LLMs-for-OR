Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": " Sure, let's approach this problem systematically. We want to find the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a target expected return of 15% while considering her risk aversion. We can use the concept of expected return and variance of a portfolio to solve this problem.\n\nLet's denote the number of blocks of Stock 1 as x and the number of blocks of Stock 2 as y. We are given the following information:\n\n* Price per block: $20 for Stock 1 and $30 for Stock 2\n* Expected return per block: $5 for Stock 1 and $10 for Stock 2\n* Variance of return per block: 4 for Stock 1 and 100 for Stock 2\n* Covariance of return between the two stocks: 5\n\nWe want to find the values of x and y that minimize the total investment while achieving an expected return of at least 15%:\n\n* Total investment = 20x + 30y\n* Expected return = 5x + 10y\n\nWe want to minimize the total investment subject to the constraint that the expected return is at least 15%:\n\n5x + 10y >= 0.15 \\* (20x + 30y)\n\nWe also want to minimize the risk of the portfolio, which is represented by the variance of the portfolio. The variance of a portfolio is given by:\n\nvariance = x^2 \\* variance of Stock 1 + y^2 \\* variance of Stock 2 + 2xy \\* covariance between the two stocks\n\nWe want to minimize the variance subject to the constraint that the expected return is at least 15%. We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve this optimization problem.\n\nLet's write a Python function to calculate the variance of the portfolio for given values of x and y:\n\n```python\ndef portfolio_variance(x, y):\n    variance_stock1 = 4\n    variance_stock2 = 100\n    covariance = 5\n    return x**2 * variance_stock1 + y**2 * variance_stock2 + 2 * x * y * covariance\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python function to minimize the total investment subject to the constraint that the expected return is at least 15%:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef minimize_investment(target_return):\n    min_investment = np.inf\n    optimal_x = None\n    optimal_y = None\n\n    for x in range(0, 10001, 1000):\n        y = (target_return - 5 * x) // 10\n        if y >= 0 and y < 10001:\n            variance = portfolio_variance(x, y)\n            if variance < min_investment:\n                min_investment = variance\n                optimal_x = x\n                optimal_y = y\n\n    return min_investment, optimal_x, optimal_y\n```\n\nNow, let's call the `minimize_investment` function with the target return of 15%:\n\n```python\nsolution = minimize_investment(0.15)\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable will contain the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15%. The value is stored in the first element of the tuple.", "code": "def portfolio_variance(x, y):\n    variance_stock1 = 4\n    variance_stock2 = 100\n    covariance = 5\n    return x**2 * variance_stock1 + y**2 * variance_stock2 + 2 * x * y * covariance\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef minimize_investment(target_return):\n    min_investment = np.inf\n    optimal_x = None\n    optimal_y = None\n\n    for x in range(0, 10001, 1000):\n        y = (target_return - 5 * x) // 10\n        if y >= 0 and y < 10001:\n            variance = portfolio_variance(x, y)\n            if variance < min_investment:\n                min_investment = variance\n                optimal_x = x\n                optimal_y = y\n\n    return min_investment, optimal_x, optimal_y\nsolution = minimize_investment(0.15)", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
