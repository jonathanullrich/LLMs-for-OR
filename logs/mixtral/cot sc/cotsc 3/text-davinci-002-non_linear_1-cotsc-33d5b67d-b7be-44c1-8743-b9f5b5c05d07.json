    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",

        " Sure, let's start by calculating the revenue function. The revenue per smoker per day is given by the base price multiplied by the consumption. So, we need to calculate the consumption as a function of the tax rate, and then multiply it by the base price. The consumption function is given as f = 53 - 100*(t/1",
        " Sure! The goal is to find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. Tax revenue is calculated as the number of cigarettes consumed multiplied by the tax rate, which is the base price per cigarette plus the tax rate. We are given the average daily consumption per smoker as a linear function of the tax rate.\n\nThe number of cigarettes consumed per day per smoker is:\n\nf = 53 - 100\\*(t/1",
        " Sure, let's break it down.\n\n1. We are given a linear function for average daily consumption per smoker (f) in terms of the tax rate (t).\n2. We need to find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.\n3. The tax revenue can be calculated as the base price per cigarette multiplied by the number of cigarettes consumed, i.e., Revenue = f * (base price per cigarette).\n4. Since f is a linear function of t, Revenue will also be a linear function of t.\n5. We need to find the value of t that maximizes this linear function.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_revenue(t):\n    f = 53 - 100 * (t / 100)\n    revenue = f * 0.15\n    return revenue\n\n# Find the tax rate that maximizes the revenue\nt_max = 0\nrevenue_max = get_revenue(t_max)\n\nfor t in range(1, 101):\n    revenue = get_revenue(t)\n    if revenue > revenue_max:\n        t_max = t\n        revenue_max = revenue\n\nsolution = t_max\n```\n\nDone! The variable `solution` now contains the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
        " Sure, let's first calculate the revenue per smoker per day as a function of the tax rate $t$:\n\nRevenue per smoker per day = (price per cigarette + tax per cigarette) \\* consumption per smoker per day\n\nWe are given that the base price per cigarette is 15 cents, and we can calculate the consumption per smoker per day as a function of $t$ as $f = 53 - 100*(t/100)$. The tax per cigarette is equal to $t$. Thus, the revenue per smoker per day can be expressed as:\n\nRevenue per smoker per day = (15 + t) \\* (53 - 100*(t/100))\n\nTo find the tax rate $t$ that maximizes the tax revenue, we need to take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to $t$, set it equal to zero, and solve for $t$.\n\nLet's write a Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbols\nt = sp.Symbol('t')\n\n# Define the revenue function\nrevenue = (15 + t) * (53 - 100*(t/100))\n\n# Take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to t\nderivative = sp.diff(revenue, t)\n\n# Solve for the critical points\ncritical_points = sp.solve(derivative, t)\n\n# Check if the critical points are maximums or minimums by using the second derivative test\nsecond_derivative = sp.diff(derivative, t)\n\n# The tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue\nsolution = critical_points[second_derivative.subs(t, critical_points[0]) > 0][0]\n```\n\nThe final output is stored in the variable `solution`. It represents the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
        " Sure, let's first determine the revenue function from cigarette taxation. The revenue from selling cigarettes is equal to the price per cigarette multiplied by the quantity demanded.\n\nRevenue = (Price per cigarette + Tax per cigarette) \\* Quantity demanded\n\nWe are given that the base price per cigarette is 15 cents, and the tax per cigarette is the tax rate t as a percentage of the base price. Therefore, the tax per cigarette is:\n\nTax per cigarette = (t/100) \\* 15 cents\n\nSubstituting this into the revenue function, we get:\n\nRevenue = (15 + (t/100) \\* 15) \\* (53 - 100\\*(t/100))\n\nTo maximize the revenue, we need to find the value of t that maximizes this revenue function.\n\nHere is the python code to solve for the optimal tax rate:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nt = sp.Symbol('t')\n\n# Define the revenue function\nrevenue = (15 + (t/100) * 15) * (53 - 100*(t/100))\n\n# Find the derivative of the revenue function with respect to t\nrevenue_derivative = sp.diff(revenue, t)\n\n# Solve for the critical point(s)\ncritical_points = sp.solve(revenue_derivative, t)\n\n# Evaluate the revenue function at the critical points\nrevenue_values = [revenue.subs(t, cp) for cp in critical_points]\n\n# Find the maximum revenue value\nsolution = max(critical_points, key=lambda x: revenue_values[revenue_values.index(x)])\n```\nIn this code, we first define the variables and revenue function, then find the derivative of the revenue function with respect to t. We then solve for the critical points of the revenue function by setting the derivative equal to zero and finding the roots. Finally, we evaluate the revenue function at each critical point and find the maximum revenue value, which is assigned to the variable 'solution'.\n\nThe output of this code is a single number representing the optimal tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue."
