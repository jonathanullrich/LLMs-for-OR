Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": [" Sure, let's break down the problem and the steps needed to solve it:\n\n1. We need to find the fastest combination of swimmers for the 200-yard medley relay.\n2. Each swimmer has a best time for each stroke (backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle).\n3. The goal is to minimize the sum of the best times for the chosen swimmers and their respective strokes.\n\nHere is a Python code that solves the problem using the `itertools` library to find the optimal combination of swimmers and strokes:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the best times for each swimmer and stroke\nswimmers_times = {\n    'Carl': {'back': 37.7, 'breast': 43.4, 'butterfly': 33.3, 'freestyle': 29.2},\n    'Chris': {'back': 32.9, 'breast': 33.1, 'butterfly': 28.5, 'freestyle': 26.4},\n    'David': {'back': 33.8, 'breast': 42.2, 'butterfly': 38.9, 'freestyle': 29.6},\n    'Tony': {'back': 37.0, 'breast': 34.7, 'butterfly': 30.4, 'freestyle': 28.5},\n    'Ken': {'back': 35.4, 'breast': 41.8, 'butterfly': 33.6, 'freestyle': 31.1}\n}\n\n# Calculate the total time for all possible combinations\nmin_time = float('inf')\nfor swimmers in itertools.combinations(swimmers_times, 4):\n    total_time = sum(min(s['back'], s['breast'], s['butterfly'], s['freestyle']) for s in swimmers)\n    min_time = min(min_time, total_time)\n\nsolution = min_time\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable contains the minimum time (in seconds) required for the 200-yard medley relay team. The code calculates the minimum time by iterating through all possible combinations of 4 swimmers and summing the minimum time for each stroke. The minimum time is then updated whenever a lower value is found.", " Sure! To solve this problem, we can use integer linear programming (ILP).
