Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",

The output is assigned to the variable 'solution'.",
        " First, we need to create a graph where nodes represent employees and edges represent shared projects between employees. The weight on each edge represents the number of shared projects.\n\nNext, we need to identify cliques in the graph. A clique is a subset of nodes where every two distinct nodes are adjacent. The size of the clique corresponds to the number of employees required for a group meeting.\n\nFinally, we need to find the minimum number of cliques that cover all nodes, i.e., the minimum number of group meetings required to include all employees.\n\nWe will use the NetworkX library to create the graph and find the cliques. The clique cover problem is NP-hard, and we will use a greedy algorithm to find an approximate solution.\n\nHere's the code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Create the graph\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add nodes to the graph\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    G.add_node(i)\n\n# Add edges to the graph\nG.add_edge(1, 2, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(1, 4, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(1, 5, weight=2)\nG.add_edge(2, 3, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(2, 5, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(3, 4, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(3, 6, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(4, 5, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(5, 6, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(5, 7, weight=2)\nG.add_edge(6, 7, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(6, 8, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(6, 10, weight=2)\nG.add_edge(7, 8, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(8, 9, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(10, 2, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(10, 4, weight=1)\nG.add_edge(10, 5, weight=1)\n\n# Find the cliques\ncliques = list(nx.find_cliques(G))\n\n# Use a greedy algorithm to find an approximate solution to the clique cover problem\ncover = []\nused_cliques = set()\nfor clique in cliques:\n    if not used_cliques.intersection(cover):\n        cover.append(clique)\n        used_cliques.update(clique)\n    else:\n        new_clique = set()\n        for node in clique:\n            if node not in used_cliques:\n                new_clique.add(node)\n                break\n        used_cliques.update(new_clique)\n        cover.append(new_clique)\n\n# Find the minimum number of employees required for group meetings\nsolution = max([len(clique) for clique in cover])\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' will contain the minimum number of employees required for group meetings.",
        " Sure, let's break it down:\n\n1. First, we need to create a list of sets where each set contains the projects that each employee is working on.\n2. Then, we find the common projects between every pair of employees, and calculate the number of employees that share each common project.\n3. We then iterate through the projects, and for each project, we schedule a meeting with the smallest number of employees who work on that project.\n4. We update the set of employees who have attended the meeting, and repeat the process until there are no more employees left to schedule a meeting.\n5. The minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room is the maximum number of employees in any single meeting.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\n# Create a list of sets where each set contains the projects that each employee is working on\nemployee_projects = [\n    {2, 4, 5},\n    {1, 3, 5},\n    {2, 3, 4, 6},\n    {3, 4, 5},\n    {1, 2, 3},\n    {1, 2, 3, 4, 6},\n    {1, 2, 5, 6},\n    {1, 3, 4},\n    {5, 6},\n    {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}\n]\n\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to store the number of employees working on each project\nproject_employee_count = {}\n\n# Count the number of employees working on each project\nfor projects in employee_projects:\n    for project in projects:\n        if project not in project_employee_count:\n            project_employee_count[project] = 0\n        project_employee_count[project] += 1\n\n# Initialize a list to store the sets of employees who have attended each meeting\nmeetings = []\n\n# While there are still employees who have not attended a meeting\nwhile len(employee_projects) > 0:\n    # Find the project with the minimum number of employees working on it\n    min_project = None\n    min_employee_count = float('inf')\n    for project, employee_count in project_employee_count.items():\n        if employee_count < min_employee_count:\n            min_project = project\n            min_employee_count = employee_count\n\n    # Initialize a set to store the employees who will attend the meeting\n    meeting_employees = set()\n\n    # Find all employees who work on the project with the minimum number of employees\n    for i, projects in enumerate(employee_projects):\n        if min_project in projects:\n            meeting_employees.add(i)\n            projects.remove(min_project)\n            if len(projects) == 0:\n                employee_projects.pop(i)\n\n    # Add the set of employees who will attend the meeting to the list of meetings\n    meetings.append(meeting_employees)\n\n# Find the maximum number of employees in any single meeting\nsolution = max(len(meeting) for meeting in meetings)\n```\n\nThe variable `solution` will hold the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room."
