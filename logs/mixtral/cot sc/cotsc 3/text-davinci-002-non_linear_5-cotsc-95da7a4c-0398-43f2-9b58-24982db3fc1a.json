    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.",

        " Sure! To solve this linear programming problem, we can use the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function in Python. Here's the code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the objective function (minimize -profit)\nc = np.array([-360, -30, -240, -120, -90, -450, -300, -180])\n\n# Define the constraints\nA_ub = np.array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]])\n\nb_ub = np.array([60, 200, 70, 20, 20, 10, 20, 20, 20])\n\n# Define the bounds\nbounds = [(None,None), (None,None), (None,None),\n          (0,None), (0,None), (0,None),\n          (0,None), (0,None), (0,None)]\n\n# Set up the linprog object and solve\nres = linprog(c=c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, bounds=bounds)\n\n# Extract the solution\nsolution = res.x\n```\nIn this code, we define the objective function as the negative of the profit, since `linprog` minimizes the objective by default. The constraints are set up in the `A_ub` matrix, and the corresponding upper bounds are set in `b_ub`. The bounds for the variables are set in the `bounds` list. Finally, we solve the linear programming problem using `linprog` and extract the solution. The `solution` variable will contain the optimal values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.",
