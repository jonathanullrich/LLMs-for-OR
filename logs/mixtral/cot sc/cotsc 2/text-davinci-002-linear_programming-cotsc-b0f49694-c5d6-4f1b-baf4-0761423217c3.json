    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?",

        " Sure! Let's start by defining the decision variables:\n\n* x1: number of units of product 1 to produce\n* x2: number of units of product 2 to produce\n\nWe want to maximize the profit function:\n\n* P(x1, x2) = $1x1 + $2x2\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n* Frame parts constraint: x1 + 3x2 \u2264 200\n* Electrical components constraint: 2x1 + 2x2 \u2264 300\n* Non-negativity constraint: x1 \u2265 0 and x2 \u2265 0\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to solve this problem using the pulp library.\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the problem\nprob = pulp.LpProblem(\"WorldLight Company\", pulp.LpMaximize)\n\n# Define the decision variables\nx1 = pulp.LpVariable(\"Product 1\", 0, None, pulp.LpContinuous)\nx2 = pulp.LpVariable(\"Product 2\", 0, 60, pulp.LpContinuous)\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob += x1 + 2*x2\n\n# Add the constraints\nprob += x1 + 3*x2 <= 200\nprob += 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nNow, `solution` holds the optimal total profit for the WorldLight Company.",
        " Sure! To solve this problem, we can use linear programming. We need to define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\n* The decision variables are x1 and x2, representing the number of units of product 1 and 2 to produce, respectively.\n* The objective function is the profit, which we want to maximize.

Create a linear programming model with two decision variables: x (number of units of product 1) and y (number of units of product 2).\n2. The objective function to maximize is profit, which is given by 1x + 2y (since each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1 and each unit of product 2 gives a profit of $2).\n3. Constraint 1: x + 3y \u2264 200 (total frame parts available)\n4. Constraint 2: 2x + 2y \u2264 300 (total electrical components available)\n5. Constraint 3: y \u2264 60 (no profit for excess units of product 2)\n6.

        " Sure, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:\n\n1.

The objective function to maximize is: profit = x + 2y (as each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2 gives a profit of $2).\n4. The constraints are:\n   - Frame parts constraint: 1x + 3y \u2264 200\n   - Electrical components constraint: 2x + 2y \u2264 300\n5.
