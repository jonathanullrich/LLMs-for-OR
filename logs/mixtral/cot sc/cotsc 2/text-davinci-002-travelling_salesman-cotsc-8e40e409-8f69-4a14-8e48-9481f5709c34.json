Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": [" Sure, let's think through this problem step by step.\n\n1. We need to minimize the number of unique employees attending each meeting.\n2. We can create a graph where the employees are the nodes and the projects they work on together are the edges.\n3. The weight of each edge is the number of employees who work on both projects.\n4. We can then find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this graph, which will give us a set of meetings where each employee is in at most one meeting.\n5. The number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room in each meeting will be the weight of the corresponding edge in the MST.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom heapq import heappop, heappush\n\ndef build_graph(employees):\n    graph = defaultdict(set)\n    for employee, projects in employees.items():\n        for project in projects:\n            for other_employee in employees:\n                if other_employee != employee and project in employees[other_employee]:\n                    graph[project].add((employee, other_employee))\n    return graph\n\ndef minimum_meetings(graph):\n    mst = set()\n    heap = [(0, None)]\n    while heap:\n        (cost, parent) = heappop(heap)\n        if parent is None or parent in mst:\n            continue\n        mst.add(parent)\n        for node in graph[parent]:\n            heappush(heap, (len(node), node))\n    return mst\n\ndef solution(employees):\n    graph = build_graph(employees)\n    mst = minimum_meetings(graph)\n    return min(len(employee) for employee in mst)\n\nemployees = {\n    1: [2, 4, 5],\n    2: [1, 3, 5],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    4: [3, 4, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3],\n    6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    7: [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    8: [1, 3, 4],\n    9: [5, 6],\n    10: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n}\nsolution = solution(employees)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThe variable `solution` will contain the minimum number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.

First, we need to determine the number of shared projects between each pair of employees. We can represent this information using an adjacency matrix or an edge list.\n2.
