The solution is assigned to the variable `solution`.", " Sure, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to determine how many pints Tom should buy from Dick and Harry today and tomorrow to minimize his total cost while satisfying his thirst requirements.\n2. Let's represent the number of pints Tom buys from Dick today as x1, from Dick tomorrow as x2, from Harry today as y1, and from Harry tomorrow as y2.\n3.
