The total cost includes the weekly rental fee and a flat fee for any rental transaction. Luxor Travel can keep the rentals for an additional week and continue paying the rent.\n\nTo solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the optimal number of weeks to keep each rental car.\n\nHere's the python code:\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Cost of renting car per week\nrental_cost = 220\n# Flat fee for any rental transaction\ntransaction_cost = 500\n\n# Number of rental cars available each week\nnum_cars_per_week = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n# Customer demand for each week\ndemand_per_week = [d // rental_cost for d in [7, 4, 7, 8]]\n\n# Initialize memo table to store the minimum cost of meeting demand up to week i\nmemo = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))\nmemo[0] = 0\n\n# Function to calculate the minimum cost of meeting demand up to week i\ndef min_cost(i):\n    if memo[i] != float('inf'):\n        return memo[i]\n    min_cost_this_week = float('inf')\n    for j in range(i):\n        # Cost of renting cars for j weeks and meeting the demand for the first i weeks\n        cost = min_cost(j) + (demand_per_week[i] - num_cars_per_week[i] + j) * rental_cost\n        # Add transaction cost if we decide to stop renting cars from week j\n        cost += (i - j) * transaction_cost\n        min_cost_this_week = min(min_cost_this_week, cost)\n    memo[i] = min_cost_this_week\n    return min_cost_this_week\n\n# Find the minimum cost of meeting the demand for all 4 weeks\nsolution = min_cost(4)\n```\nIn this code, we initialize a memo table to store the minimum cost of meeting the demand up to a certain week. We start by calculating the minimum cost of meeting the demand for the first week, which is just the transaction cost. Then, we calculate the minimum cost of meeting the demand for each subsequent week by considering all possible ways to partition the demand for that week into two parts: one part to be met by renting new cars, and the other part to be met by continuing to rent cars from previous weeks. We update the memo table with the minimum cost of meeting the demand up to each week, and finally, we return the minimum cost of meeting the demand for all 4 weeks.\n\nNote that in this code, we assume that the demand for each week is less than or equal to the number of rental cars available that week. If this is not the case, we need to adjust the `demand_per_week` array to make sure it is feasible.", "code": "from collections import defaultdict\n\n# Cost of renting car per week\nrental_cost = 220\n# Flat fee for any rental transaction\ntransaction_cost = 500\n\n# Number of rental cars available each week\nnum_cars_per_week = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n# Customer demand for each week\ndemand_per_week = [d // rental_cost for d in [7, 4, 7, 8]]\n\n# Initialize memo table to store the minimum cost of meeting demand up to week i\nmemo = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))\nmemo[0] = 0\n\n# Function to calculate the minimum cost of meeting demand up to week i\ndef min_cost(i):\n    if memo[i] != float('inf'):\n        return memo[i]\n    min_cost_this_week = float('inf')\n    for j in range(i):\n        # Cost of renting cars for j weeks and meeting the demand for the first i weeks\n        cost = min_cost(j) + (demand_per_week[i] - num_cars_per_week[i] + j) * rental_cost\n        # Add transaction cost if we decide to stop renting cars from week j\n        cost += (i - j) * transaction_cost\n        min_cost_this_week = min(min_cost_this_week, cost)\n    memo[i] = min_cost_this_week\n    return min_cost_this_week\n\n# Find the minimum cost of meeting the demand for all 4 weeks\nsolution = min_cost(4)", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
