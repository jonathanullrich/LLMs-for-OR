Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": "Here are a few examples how to solve operations research problems:\nProblem: MG Auto has three plants in Los Angeles, Detroit, and New Orleans and two major distribution centers in Denver and Miami.

Since the profit functions for both products provide decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased, we can model this problem as a non-linear programming problem. We can use the `scipy.optimize` library's `minimize` function to find the optimal production rate that maximizes the total profit.\n\nTo model the objective function, we need to add the profit functions for both products and maximize it. The constraints are the production rate limit of 2 units per hour and non-negativity constraints for the production rates of both products.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef objective_function(x):\n    return -(200*x[0] - 100*x[0]**2 + 300*x[1] - 100*x[1]**2 - 100*x[0]*x[1])\n\ndef constraint_function(x):\n    return x[0] + x[1] - 2\n\ninitial_guess = [1, 1]\n\nconstraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint_function})\n\nbounds = ((0, None), (0, None))\n\nsolution = -1*minimize(objective_function, initial_guess, bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints).fun\n```\n\nHere, `objective_function` calculates the total profit function, which is the sum of the profit functions for both products minus the interaction term between the two products due to shared production facilities. The `constraint_function` is used to enforce the production rate limit, and `initial_guess` is the initial guess for the production rates of both products. The `bounds` parameter sets the non-negativity constraints for both products. The `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to find the optimal production rates that maximize the total profit.\n\nThe `minimize` function returns the negative maximum profit, so we multiply it by -1 to get the maximum profit. The `solution` variable contains the maximum profit.", "code": "from scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef objective_function(x):\n    return -(200*x[0] - 100*x[0]**2 + 300*x[1] - 100*x[1]**2 - 100*x[0]*x[1])\n\ndef constraint_function(x):\n    return x[0] + x[1] - 2\n\ninitial_guess = [1, 1]\n\nconstraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint_function})\n\nbounds = ((0, None), (0, None))\n\nsolution = -1*minimize(objective_function, initial_guess, bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints).fun", "solution": 224.9999999991208}
