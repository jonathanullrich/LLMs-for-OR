The objective is to find the shortest route that visits all edges of a graph at least once, starting and ending at the same point.\n\nFirst, let's create the graph and calculate the degree of each node:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ngraph = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\nedges = {('A', 'B'): 2, ('A', 'C'): 2, ('B', 'C'): 3, ('B', 'D'): 4, ('D', 'E'): 3,\n         ('D', 'F'): 4, ('E', 'F'): 9, ('E', 'G'): 3, ('F', 'G'): 5, ('G', 'H'): 3}\n\nfor edge, weight in edges.items():\n    u, v = edge\n    graph[u][v] = weight\n    graph[v][u] = weight\n\ndegrees = {node: sum(graph[node].values()) for node in graph}\n```\n\nNext, we find the odd-degree nodes:\n\n```python\nodd_degree_nodes = [node for node in graph if degrees[node] % 2 != 0]\n```\n\nIf there are no odd-degree nodes, the solution would be the sum of all edges. However, in this case, there is an odd-degree node 'B' with a degree of 5. So, we need to find the shortest path between the two odd-degree nodes ('B' and itself) and add it to the graph.\n\nTo do this, we will use the following function:\n\n```python\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    shortest_paths = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}\n    shortest_paths[start] = 0\n\n    current = start\n    while current != end:\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current].items():\n            new_distance = shortest_paths[current] + weight\n            if new_distance < shortest_paths[neighbor]:\n                shortest_paths[neighbor] = new_distance\n\n        current = min(shortest_paths, key=shortest_paths.get)\n\n    return shortest_paths[end]\n\n# Find the shortest path between 'B' and itself and add it to the graph\nshortest_path_weight = shortest_path(graph, 'B', 'B')\nedges[('B', 'B')] = shortest_path_weight\n```\n\nNow, we can calculate the total weight (length) of the graph, which is the solution:\n\n```python\ntotal_weight = sum(edges.values())\nsolution = total_weight\n```\n\nThe variable `solution` contains the shortest route that visits all the streets at least once, starting and ending at point A.
