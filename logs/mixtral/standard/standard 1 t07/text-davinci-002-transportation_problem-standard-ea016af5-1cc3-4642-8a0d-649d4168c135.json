Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can use linear programming to minimize the cost of purchasing home brew.

We then define the objective function to minimize the total cost and add the constraints for Tom's thirst requirements, Dick's and Harry's maximum pint limits.
