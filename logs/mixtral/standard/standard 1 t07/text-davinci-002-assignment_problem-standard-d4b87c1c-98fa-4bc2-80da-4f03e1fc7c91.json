Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can use the assignment problem algorithm. Since the problem can be modeled as finding the optimal assignment of swimmers to strokes to minimize the total time, we can use the Hungarian algorithm to solve it. Here is the python code to solve the problem using the `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` function, which implements the Hungarian algorithm:\n```makefile\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the best times in a matrix\nbest_times = np.array([\n    [37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],\n    [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],\n    [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],\n    [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],\n    [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1],\n]).T\n\n# Use linear sum assignment to find the optimal assignment\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\nrow_indices, col_indices = linear_sum_assignment(best_times)\n\n# Calculate the minimum time spent\nmin_time = np.sum(best_times[row_indices, col_indices])\n\n# Assign the minimum time to the solution variable\nsolution = min_time\n```\nThe variable `solution` now contains the minimum time spent by the relay team. The `row_indices` and `col_indices` variables contain the indices of the rows and columns of the optimal assignment, respectively. Therefore, `row_indices` contains the indices of the swimmers and `col_indices` contains the indices of the strokes in the optimal assignment.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
