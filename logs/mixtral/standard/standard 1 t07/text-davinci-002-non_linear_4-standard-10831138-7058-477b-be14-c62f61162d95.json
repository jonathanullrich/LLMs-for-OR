Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "output": "\nThe problem can be solved by using the concept of Lagrange multipliers to find the optimal production rate for each product that maximizes the total profit while satisfying the production constraint.\n\nHere's the python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef profit_function(x):\n    R1, R2 = x\n    return 200*R1 - 100*R1**2 + 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\n\ndef constraint(x):\n    R1, R2 = x\n    return R1 + R2 - 2\n\ncons = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint})\n\nx0 = np.array([1, 1])\n\nsolution = minimize(profit_function, x0, constraints=cons).fun\n```\n\nThe value of 'solution' will be the maximum total profit.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef profit_function(x):\n    R1, R2 = x\n    return 200*R1 - 100*R1**2 + 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\n\ndef constraint(x):\n    R1, R2 = x\n    return R1 + R2 - 2\n\ncons = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': constraint})\n\nx0 = np.array([1, 1])\n\nsolution = minimize(profit_function, x0, constraints=cons).fun", "solution": NaN}
