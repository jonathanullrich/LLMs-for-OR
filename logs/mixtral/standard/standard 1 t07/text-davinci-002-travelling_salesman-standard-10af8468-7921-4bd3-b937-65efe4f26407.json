{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can use a graph-based approach where each employee is a node and each shared project is an edge between nodes. Then, we can find the maximum clique (a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent) in the graph, which represents a group of employees who can be met together as they share the most number of projects.\n\nWe can use the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to find the maximum clique in a graph. Here's the Python code using the NetworkX library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Define the graph\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add nodes and edges based on the problem statement\nnodes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nedges = [(1, 2, 2), (1, 4, 4), (1, 5, 5), (2, 1, 1), (2, 3, 3), (2, 5, 5), (3, 2, 2), (3, 4, 4), (3, 6, 6), (4, 3, 3), (4, 5, 5), (5, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2), (5, 3, 3), (6, 1, 1), (6, 2, 2), (6, 3, 3), (6, 4, 4), (7, 1, 1), (7, 2, 2), (7, 5, 5), (7, 6, 6), (8, 1, 1), (8, 3, 3), (8, 4, 4), (9, 5, 5), (9, 6, 6), (10, 1, 1), (10, 2, 2), (10, 4, 4), (10, 5, 5), (10, 6, 6)]\n\nG.add_nodes_from(nodes)\nG.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)\n\n# Find the maximum clique\nmax_clique = max(nx.find_cliques(G), key=len)\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\nsolution = max(len(max_clique), len(nodes) - len(max_clique))\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' will contain the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "code": "import networkx as nx\n\n# Define the graph\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add nodes and edges based on the problem statement\nnodes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nedges = [(1, 2, 2), (1, 4, 4), (1, 5, 5), (2, 1, 1), (2, 3, 3), (2, 5, 5), (3, 2, 2), (3, 4, 4), (3, 6, 6), (4, 3, 3), (4, 5, 5), (5, 1, 1), (5, 2, 2), (5, 3, 3), (6, 1, 1), (6, 2, 2), (6, 3, 3), (6, 4, 4), (7, 1, 1), (7, 2, 2), (7, 5, 5), (7, 6, 6), (8, 1, 1), (8, 3, 3), (8, 4, 4), (9, 5, 5), (9, 6, 6), (10, 1, 1), (10, 2, 2), (10, 4, 4), (10, 5, 5), (10, 6, 6)]\n\nG.add_nodes_from(nodes)\nG.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)\n\n# Find the maximum clique\nmax_clique = max(nx.find_cliques(G), key=len)\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\nsolution = max(len(max_clique), len(nodes) - len(max_clique))", "solution": 6}
