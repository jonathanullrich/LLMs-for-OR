Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of portfolio optimization. We want to find the optimal allocation of Ann's funds between the two stocks such that the expected return is at least 15% and the risk is minimized. We can use the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to find the optimal allocation. \n\nFirst, let's compute the expected return and variance of a portfolio consisting of two stocks.\n\nExpected return of the portfolio:\n\nr\\_p = w\\_1*r\\_1 + w\\_2*r\\_2\n\nVariance of the portfolio:\n\nvar\\_p = w\\_1^2*var\\_1 + w\\_2^2*var\\_2 + 2*w\\_1*w\\_2*cov(1,2)\n\nwhere:\n\nw\\_1 and w\\_2 are the weights or fractions of the total investment in stock 1 and 2, respectively\nr\\_1 and r\\_2 are the expected returns per block of stock 1 and 2, respectively\nvar\\_1 and var\\_2 are the variances of the returns per block of stock 1 and 2, respectively\ncov(1,2) is the covariance of the returns per block of stock 1 and 2.\n\nWe can now write a python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Inputs\nr1 = 5\nr2 = 10\nvar1 = 4\nvar2 = 100\ncov12 = 5\nw1 = 0\nw2 = 0\ntarget_return = 15\n\n# Calculate the expected return and variance of a portfolio\ndef expected_return(w1, w2, r1, r2):\n    return w1*r1 + w2*r2\n\ndef variance(w1, w2, var1, var2, cov12):\n    return w1**2*var1 + w2**2*var2 + 2*w1*w2*cov1", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
