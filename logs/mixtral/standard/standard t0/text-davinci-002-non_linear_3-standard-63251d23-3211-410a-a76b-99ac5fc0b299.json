Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of portfolio optimization. We want to find the optimal allocation of Ann's funds between the two stocks such that the expected return is at least 15% while minimizing the risk.\n\nWe can use the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to calculate the optimal allocation. The MPT considers the expected return and risk (represented by variance) of the portfolio, as well as the correlation between the assets.\n\nThe expected return of the portfolio is given by:\n\nExpected Return = w1 \\* Expected Return1 + w2 \\* Expected Return2\n\nwhere w1 and w2 are the weights of the two stocks in the portfolio.\n\nThe variance of the portfolio is given by:\n\nVariance = w1^2 \\* Variance1 + w2^2 \\* Variance2 + 2 \\* w1 \\* w2 \\* Covariance\n\nwhere Variance1 and Variance2 are the variances of the two stocks, and Covariance is the covariance between the two stocks.\n\nWe want to minimize the variance subject to the constraint that the expected return is at least 15%.\n\nWe can use the `scipy.optimize` library to solve this optimization problem.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Define the parameters\nExpected_Return1 = 5\nExpected_Return2 = 10\nVariance1 = 4\nVariance2 = 100\nCovariance = 5\n\n# Define the optimization problem\ndef objective(weights):\n    return weights[0]**2 * Variance1 + weights[1]**2 * Variance2 + 2 * weights[0] * weights[1] * Covariance\n\ndef constraint(weights):\n    return Expected_Return1 * weights[0] + Expected_Return2 * weights[1] - 0.15\n\n# Set the initial weights\nweights0 = np.array([0.5, 0.5])\n\n# Solve the optimization problem\nresult = minimize(objective, weights0, method='SLSQP', constraints={\"type\": \"eq\", \"fun\": constraint})\n\n# Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest\nMin_Investment = 50000 / result.x[0] * 1000\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = Min_Investment\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable contains the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15%.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Define the parameters\nExpected_Return1 = 5\nExpected_Return2 = 10\nVariance1 = 4\nVariance2 = 100\nCovariance = 5\n\n# Define the optimization problem\ndef objective(weights):\n    return weights[0]**2 * Variance1 + weights[1]**2 * Variance2 + 2 * weights[0] * weights[1] * Covariance\n\ndef constraint(weights):\n    return Expected_Return1 * weights[0] + Expected_Return2 * weights[1] - 0.15\n\n# Set the initial weights\nweights0 = np.array([0.5, 0.5])\n\n# Solve the optimization problem\nresult = minimize(objective, weights0, method='SLSQP', constraints={\"type\": \"eq\", \"fun\": constraint})\n\n# Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest\nMin_Investment = 50000 / result.x[0] * 1000\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = Min_Investment", "solution": 1777776875.132275}
