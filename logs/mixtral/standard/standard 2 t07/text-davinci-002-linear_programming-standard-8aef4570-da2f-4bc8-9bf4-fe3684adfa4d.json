{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "output": "\n\nHere's a Python code to solve this problem using linear programming:\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the problem\nprob = pulp.LpProblem(\"LightFixtureProduction\", pulp.LpMaximize)\n\n# Define the decision variables\nproduct1 = pulp.LpVariable(\"Product1\", 0, None, cat='Integer')\nproduct2 = pulp.LpVariable(\"Product2\", 0, 60, cat='Integer')\n\n# Add the objective function\nprob += product1 + 2 * product2\n\n# Add the constraints\nprob += product1 + 3 * product2 <= 200\nprob += 2 * product1 + 2 * product2 <= 300\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nThe variable `solution` will contain the total profit.", "code": "import pulp\n\n# Define the problem\nprob = pulp.LpProblem(\"LightFixtureProduction\", pulp.LpMaximize)\n\n# Define the decision variables\nproduct1 = pulp.LpVariable(\"Product1\", 0, None, cat='Integer')\nproduct2 = pulp.LpVariable(\"Product2\", 0, 60, cat='Integer')\n\n# Add the objective function\nprob += product1 + 2 * product2\n\n# Add the constraints\nprob += product1 + 3 * product2 <= 200\nprob += 2 * product1 + 2 * product2 <= 300\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)", "solution": 175.0}
