He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "output": "s> To solve this problem, we can use the Held-Karp algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP aims to find the shortest possible route that visits all given nodes (streets in this case) and returns to the starting point. Since the postman can walk through a street multiple times and in both directions, we can add a dummy node with zero length edges to all other nodes to simplify the problem.
