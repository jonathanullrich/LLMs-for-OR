{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.", "output": "\nThis problem can be solved using linear programming. The objective is to maximize the total estimated profit, subject to certain constraints. Here's the Python code using the PuLP library to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom pulp import LpMaximize, LpVariable, LpProblem, value\n\n# Define the decision variables\npartnership1 = LpVariable('partnership1', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\npartnership2 = LpVariable('partnership2', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the problem\nprob = LpProblem('Investment Problem', LpMaximize)\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob += 9000 * partnership1 + 9000 * partnership2\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += 10000 * partnership1 + 8000 * partnership2 <= 12000\n400 * partnership1 + 500 * partnership2 <= 600\npartnership1 >= 0\npartnership2 >= 0\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to 'solution'\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\n```\nThe code creates two decision variables: partnership1 and partnership2, which represent the fraction of a full partnership in each of the ventures. The objective function maximizes the total estimated profit, and the constraints ensure that the investment does not exceed the $12,000 available and that the time investment does not exceed 600 hours. The solution assigns the maximum total estimated profit to the variable 'solution'.", "code": "from pulp import LpMaximize, LpVariable, LpProblem, value\n\n# Define the decision variables\npartnership1 = LpVariable('partnership1', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\npartnership2 = LpVariable('partnership2', lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the problem\nprob = LpProblem('Investment Problem', LpMaximize)\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob += 9000 * partnership1 + 9000 * partnership2\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += 10000 * partnership1 + 8000 * partnership2 <= 12000\n400 * partnership1 + 500 * partnership2 <= 600\npartnership1 >= 0\npartnership2 >= 0\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to 'solution'\nsolution = value(prob.objective)", "solution": 13500.0}
