Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "output": "\nTo find the minimum amount Ann has to invest to achieve a 15% return, we first need to calculate the expected return and risk (standard deviation) of a portfolio with different allocations to stock 1 and stock 2. We can use the formula for the expected return and standard deviation of a portfolio:\n\nExpected return: r\\_p = w\\_1 * r\\_1 + w\\_2 * r\\_2\n\nStandard deviation: \u03c3\\_p = sqrt(w\\_1^2 * \u03c3\\_1^2 + w\\_2^2 * \u03c3\\_2^2 + 2 * w\\_1 * w\\_2 * \u03c3\\_1 * \u03c3\\_2 * \u03c1)\n\nwhere:\n* w\\_1, w\\_2: weights of stock 1 and 2, respectively\n* r\\_1, r\\_2: expected returns of stock 1 and 2, respectively\n* \u03c3\\_1, \u03c3\\_2: standard deviations of stock 1 and 2, respectively\n* \u03c1: correlation coefficient between the stocks\n\nSince we are given the covariance instead of the correlation coefficient, we can calculate the correlation coefficient as:\n\n\u03c1 = (\u03c3\\_1 * \u03c3\\_2 * covariance) / (\u03c3\\_1 * \u03c3\\_2)\n\nWe can then use these formulas to calculate the expected return and standard deviation for various allocations to stock 1 and stock 2, and find the allocation that gives a 15% return.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\n# Inputs\nr_1 = 5 # expected return per block of stock 1 in thousands of dollars\nr_2 = 10 # expected return per block of stock 2 in thousands of dollars\n\n\u03c3_1 = 2 # standard deviation per block of stock 1\n\u03c3_2 = 10 # standard deviation per block of stock 2\n\ncovariance = 5 # covariance between stock 1 and stock 2\n\ntarget_return = 15 # target return in percentage points\n\n# Calculate the correlation coefficient\n\u03c1 = (\u03c3_1 * \u03c3_2 * covariance) / (\u03c3_1 * \u03c3_2)\n\n# Initialize the weight of stock 1 and the minimum investment amount\nw_1 = 0\nmin_investment = 0\n\n# Loop through possible weights of stock 1\nwhile w_1 <= 1:\n    # Calculate the weight of stock 2\n    w_2 = 1 - w_1\n\n    # Calculate the expected return of the portfolio\n    r_p = w_1 * r_1 + w_2 * r_2\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation of the portfolio\n    \u03c3_p = sqrt(w_1^2 * \u03c3_1^2 + w_2^2 * \u03c3_2^2 + 2 * w_1 * w_2 * \u03c3_1 * \u03c3_2 * \u03c1)\n\n    # Calculate the number of blocks of stock 1 needed\n    blocks_1 = w_1 * Ann_investment / 1000\n\n    # Calculate the number of blocks of stock 2 needed\n    blocks_2 = w_2 * Ann_investment / 1000\n\n    # Check if the expected return is greater than or equal to the target return\n    if r_p >= target_return:\n        # Update the minimum investment amount\n        min_investment = max(min_investment, blocks_1 * 2000 + blocks_2 * 3000)\n\n    # Increase the weight of stock 1\n    w_1 += 0.01\n\n# Output the minimum investment amount\nsolution = min_investment\n```\nThe `solution` variable will contain the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "code": "# Inputs\nr_1 = 5 # expected return per block of stock 1 in thousands of dollars\nr_2 = 10 # expected return per block of stock 2 in thousands of dollars\n\n\u03c3_1 = 2 # standard deviation per block of stock 1\n\u03c3_2 = 10 # standard deviation per block of stock 2\n\ncovariance = 5 # covariance between stock 1 and stock 2\n\ntarget_return = 15 # target return in percentage points\n\n# Calculate the correlation coefficient\n\u03c1 = (\u03c3_1 * \u03c3_2 * covariance) / (\u03c3_1 * \u03c3_2)\n\n# Initialize the weight of stock 1 and the minimum investment amount\nw_1 = 0\nmin_investment = 0\n\n# Loop through possible weights of stock 1\nwhile w_1 <= 1:\n    # Calculate the weight of stock 2\n    w_2 = 1 - w_1\n\n    # Calculate the expected return of the portfolio\n    r_p = w_1 * r_1 + w_2 * r_2\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation of the portfolio\n    \u03c3_p = sqrt(w_1^2 * \u03c3_1^2 + w_2^2 * \u03c3_2^2 + 2 * w_1 * w_2 * \u03c3_1 * \u03c3_2 * \u03c1)\n\n    # Calculate the number of blocks of stock 1 needed\n    blocks_1 = w_1 * Ann_investment / 1000\n\n    # Calculate the number of blocks of stock 2 needed\n    blocks_2 = w_2 * Ann_investment / 1000\n\n    # Check if the expected return is greater than or equal to the target return\n    if r_p >= target_return:\n        # Update the minimum investment amount\n        min_investment = max(min_investment, blocks_1 * 2000 + blocks_2 * 3000)\n\n    # Increase the weight of stock 1\n    w_1 += 0.01\n\n# Output the minimum investment amount\nsolution = min_investment", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
