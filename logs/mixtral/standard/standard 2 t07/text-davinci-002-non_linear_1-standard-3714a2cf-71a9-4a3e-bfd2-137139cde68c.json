Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "output": "\nTo find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we first need to calculate the revenue function. The revenue from cigarettes can be calculated as the tax rate multiplied by the number of cigarettes smoked. Since the number of cigarettes smoked is a linear function of the tax rate, the revenue function will be a quadratic function.\n\nWe can find the maximum of this quadratic function by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero, then solving for the tax rate.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the demand function\nt = sp.Symbol('t')\ndemand = 53 - 100*(t/100)\n\n# Define the revenue function\nrevenue = t * demand\n\n# Take the derivative of the revenue function\nrevenue_derivative = revenue.diff(t)\n\n# Solve for the tax rate that maximizes the revenue\nsolution = sp.solve(revenue_derivative, t)[0]\n\n# Convert the symbolic solution to a numeric value\nsolution = float(solution.evalf())\n```\n\nThe variable `solution` will contain the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. The value of `solution` will be approximately `26.5`.", "code": "import sympy as sp\n\n# Define the demand function\nt = sp.Symbol('t')\ndemand = 53 - 100*(t/100)\n\n# Define the revenue function\nrevenue = t * demand\n\n# Take the derivative of the revenue function\nrevenue_derivative = revenue.diff(t)\n\n# Solve for the tax rate that maximizes the revenue\nsolution = sp.solve(revenue_derivative, t)[0]\n\n# Convert the symbolic solution to a numeric value\nsolution = float(solution.evalf())", "solution": 26.5}
