{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "output": "\nTo minimize the cost, Luxor Travel should aim to rent cars for the minimum number of weeks required to meet demand, while also minimizing the number of additional weekly rentals and associated flat fees. Here is a Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\n# Define the weekly demand\ndemand = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Define the rental fee and flat fee\nrental_fee = 220\nflat_fee = 500\n\n# Initialize a list to store the minimum number of weeks to meet demand for each week\nmin\\_weeks = [0] * len(demand)\n\n# Initialize the minimum cost\nmin\\_cost = 0\n\n# Iterate through the weeks\nfor i in range(len(demand)):\n    # If the demand for the week is greater than the number of cars available\n    if demand[i] > 7:\n        # Set the minimum number of weeks to meet demand for this week to 2\n        min\\_weeks[i] = 2\n        # Add the rental fee for 2 weeks and the flat fee for 1 rental transaction\n        min\\_cost += 2 * rental\\_fee + flat\\_fee\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, set the minimum number of weeks to meet demand for this week to 1\n        min\\_weeks[i] = 1\n        # Add the rental fee for 1 week\n        min\\_cost += rental\\_fee\n\n# Print the minimum cost\nprint(\"The minimum cost is $\", min\\_cost)\nsolution = min\\_cost\n```\n\nThis code calculates the minimum number of weeks required to meet demand for each week, while minimizing the number of additional weekly rentals and associated flat fees.
