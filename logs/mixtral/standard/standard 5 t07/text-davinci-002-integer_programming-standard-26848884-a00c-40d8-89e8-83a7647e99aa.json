{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, you can use linear programming. Here's the python code using the PuLP library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import LpVariable, LpProblem, LpMinimize, value\n\n# Define the variables and their bounds\nx1 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Marketing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx2 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Cooking\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx3 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Dishwashing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx4 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Laundry\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\ny1 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Marketing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny2 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Cooking\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny3 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Dishwashing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny4 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Laundry\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the problem and the objective function\nprob = LpProblem(\"Household_Chores\", LpMinimize)\nprob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + y1 + y2 + y3 + y4, \"Total_Time\"\n\n# Add the constraints\nprob += x1 + y1 >= 4.5  # Marketing constraint\nprob += x2 + y2 >= 7.8  # Cooking constraint\nprob += x3 + y3 >= 3.6  # Dishwashing constraint\nprob += x4 + y4 >= 2.9  # Laundry constraint\nprob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 == 2  # Eve has 2 tasks\nprob += y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 == 2  # Steven has 2 tasks\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the total time to the 'solution' variable\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nIn this code, we minimize the total time spent on household chores by both Eve and Steven with the given efficiency data for each task. The constraints ensure that each person has two tasks, and the time spent on each task is greater than or equal to the given time. The 'solution' variable will contain the optimal time spent to do the chores.", "code": "from pulp import LpVariable, LpProblem, LpMinimize, value\n\n# Define the variables and their bounds\nx1 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Marketing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx2 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Cooking\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx3 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Dishwashing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\nx4 = LpVariable(\"Eve_Laundry\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\ny1 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Marketing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny2 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Cooking\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny3 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Dishwashing\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\ny4 = LpVariable(\"Steven_Laundry\", lowBound=0, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the problem and the objective function\nprob = LpProblem(\"Household_Chores\", LpMinimize)\nprob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + y1 + y2 + y3 + y4, \"Total_Time\"\n\n# Add the constraints\nprob += x1 + y1 >= 4.5  # Marketing constraint\nprob += x2 + y2 >= 7.8  # Cooking constraint\nprob += x3 + y3 >= 3.6  # Dishwashing constraint\nprob += x4 + y4 >= 2.9  # Laundry constraint\nprob += x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 == 2  # Eve has 2 tasks\nprob += y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 == 2  # Steven has 2 tasks\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the total time to the 'solution' variable\nsolution = value(prob.objective)", "solution": 12.3}
