{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "output": "\n\nHere's a Python code to solve the linear programming problem:\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Objective function: maximize profit\nprofit = pulp.LpProblem('Maximize Profit', pulp.LpMaximize)\n\n# Decision variables\nproduct1 = pulp.LpVariable('Product1', 0, None, pulp.LpContinuous)\nproduct2 = pulp.LpVariable('Product2', 0, 60, pulp.LpContinuous)\n\n# Add objective function\nprofit += 1 * product1 + 2 * product2\n\n# Constraints\n# Frame parts constraint\nprofit += 1 * product1 + 3 * product2 <= 200\n\n# Electrical components constraint\nprofit += 2 * product1 + 2 * product2 <= 300\n\n# Solve the problem\nstatus = profit.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = pulp.value(profit.objective)\n```\n\nThe code creates a linear programming problem and solves it using the `pulp` library. The decision variables are `product1` and `product2`, and the objective is to maximize the profit. The constraints involve the availability of frame parts and electrical components. The optimal value of the objective function is assigned to the variable `solution`.", "code": "import pulp\n\n# Objective function: maximize profit\nprofit = pulp.LpProblem('Maximize Profit', pulp.LpMaximize)\n\n# Decision variables\nproduct1 = pulp.LpVariable('Product1', 0, None, pulp.LpContinuous)\nproduct2 = pulp.LpVariable('Product2', 0, 60, pulp.LpContinuous)\n\n# Add objective function\nprofit += 1 * product1 + 2 * product2\n\n# Constraints\n# Frame parts constraint\nprofit += 1 * product1 + 3 * product2 <= 200\n\n# Electrical components constraint\nprofit += 2 * product1 + 2 * product2 <= 300\n\n# Solve the problem\nstatus = profit.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'\nsolution = pulp.value(profit.objective)", "solution": 175.0}
