{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "output": "\n\nHere is the python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef tax_revenue(t):\n    consumption = max(53 - 100 * (t / 100), 0)\n    return consumption * 0.15 * t\n\ndef maximize_tax_revenue():\n    max_revenue = 0\n    max_tax_rate = 0\n    for t in range(0, 101):\n        revenue = tax_revenue(t)\n        if revenue > max_revenue:\n            max_revenue = revenue\n            max_tax_rate = t\n    return max_tax_rate\n\nsolution = maximize_tax_revenue()\n```\n\nThe `maximize_tax_revenue` function iterates through possible tax rates from 0% to 100% and calculates the tax revenue for each tax rate with the `tax_revenue` function. It then updates the maximum revenue and corresponding tax rate when it encounters a higher revenue. The final solution is the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "code": "def tax_revenue(t):\n    consumption = max(53 - 100 * (t / 100), 0)\n    return consumption * 0.15 * t\n\ndef maximize_tax_revenue():\n    max_revenue = 0\n    max_tax_rate = 0\n    for t in range(0, 101):\n        revenue = tax_revenue(t)\n        if revenue > max_revenue:\n            max_revenue = revenue\n            max_tax_rate = t\n    return max_tax_rate\n\nsolution = maximize_tax_revenue()", "solution": 26}
