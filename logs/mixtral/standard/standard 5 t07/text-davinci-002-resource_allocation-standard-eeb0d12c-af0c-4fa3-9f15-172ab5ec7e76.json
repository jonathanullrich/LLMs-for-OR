Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "output": "\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find the optimal number of weeks to keep each car.
