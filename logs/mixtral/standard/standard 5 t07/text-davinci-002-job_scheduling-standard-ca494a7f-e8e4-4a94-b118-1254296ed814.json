We will keep track of the earliest time when all jobs can be completed, which we will call the makespan.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\n# Given processing times and deadlines\nprocessing_times = [6, 4, 5, 8]\ndeadlines = [8, 4, 12, 16]\n\n# Sort jobs by deadline\njobs = sorted(range(len(processing_times)), key=lambda i: deadlines[i])\n\n# Initialize makespan to the deadline of the first job\nmakespan = deadlines[jobs[0]]\n\n# Process jobs in order of deadline\nfor job in jobs:\n    # Subtract processing time and update makespan\n    makespan = max(makespan, deadlines[job] - processing_times[job])\n\n# The minimal time to process the jobs is the makespan\nsolution = makespan\n```\nThe output of this code is assigned to the variable 'solution'.
