Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can use a graph-based approach. We will create a graph where nodes represent employees and edges represent shared projects between employees. Then, we will find the maximum clique in the graph, which is a set of nodes that are all connected to each other. The size of the maximum clique will be the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\nfrom typing import List, Set\n\ndef shared\\_projects(e1: Set[int], e2: Set[int]) -> bool:\nreturn bool(e1 & e2)\n\ndef max\\_clique(g: List[Set[int]]) -> int:\nn = len(g)\nfor k in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\nfor c in combinations(range(n), k):\nif all(shared\\_projects(g[u], g[v]) for u, v in combinations(c, 2)):\nreturn k\nreturn 1\n\n# Define the shared projects for each employee\nemployees = [\n{2, 4, 5},\n{1, 3, 5},\n{2, 3, 4, 6},\n{3, 4, 5},\n{1, 2, 3},\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 6},\n{1, 2, 5, 6},\n{1, 3, 4},\n{5, 6},\n{1, 2, 4, 5, 6}\n]\n\n# Find the maximum clique\nsolution = max\\_clique(employees)\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function `shared_projects` to check if two employees share any projects. We also define a function `max_clique` to find the maximum clique in a graph represented as a list of sets. The main logic is in the `max_clique` function, where we iterate through combinations of nodes and check if they form a clique.\n\nThe solution variable will contain the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room, which is the size of the maximum clique.", "code": "from itertools import combinations\nfrom typing import List, Set\n\ndef shared\\_projects(e1: Set[int], e2: Set[int]) -> bool:\nreturn bool(e1 & e2)\n\ndef max\\_clique(g: List[Set[int]]) -> int:\nn = len(g)\nfor k in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\nfor c in combinations(range(n), k):\nif all(shared\\_projects(g[u], g[v]) for u, v in combinations(c, 2)):\nreturn k\nreturn 1\n\n# Define the shared projects for each employee\nemployees = [\n{2, 4, 5},\n{1, 3, 5},\n{2, 3, 4, 6},\n{3, 4, 5},\n{1, 2, 3},\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 6},\n{1, 2, 5, 6},\n{1, 3, 4},\n{5, 6},\n{1, 2, 4, 5, 6}\n]\n\n# Find the maximum clique\nsolution = max\\_clique(employees)", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
