He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3).
