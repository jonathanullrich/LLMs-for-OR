Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "output": "\nStep 1: Convert all dollar values to 1000-dollar units\nStep 2: Calculate the expected return and variance of a portfolio with different allocations\nStep 3: Use optimization to find the minimum amount to invest to achieve a 15% return\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Step 1: Convert all dollar values to 1000-dollar units\nstock1_price = 20\nstock2_price = 30\nstock1_amount = 50000 / stock1_price\nstock2_amount = 50000 / stock2_price\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the expected return and variance of a portfolio with different allocations\ndef portfolio_return(x):\n    return x[0] * 5 + x[1] * 10\n\ndef portfolio_variance(x):\n    return x[0]**2 * 4 + x[1]**2 * 100 + 2 * x[0] * x[1] * 5\n\n# Step 3: Use optimization to find the minimum amount to invest to achieve a 15% return\ntarget_return = 0.15\ncons = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda x: portfolio_return(x) - target_return * (x[0] + x[1])})\nbounds = [(0, stock1_amount), (0, stock2_amount)]\n\nsolution = minimize(portfolio_variance, np.array([1, 0]), bounds=bounds, constraints=cons).x\nsolution = solution[0] + solution[1]\n```\n\nThe final output, 'solution', is the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Step 1: Convert all dollar values to 1000-dollar units\nstock1_price = 20\nstock2_price = 30\nstock1_amount = 50000 / stock1_price\nstock2_amount = 50000 / stock2_price\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the expected return and variance of a portfolio with different allocations\ndef portfolio_return(x):\n    return x[0] * 5 + x[1] * 10\n\ndef portfolio_variance(x):\n    return x[0]**2 * 4 + x[1]**2 * 100 + 2 * x[0] * x[1] * 5\n\n# Step 3: Use optimization to find the minimum amount to invest to achieve a 15% return\ntarget_return = 0.15\ncons = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda x: portfolio_return(x) - target_return * (x[0] + x[1])})\nbounds = [(0, stock1_amount), (0, stock2_amount)]\n\nsolution = minimize(portfolio_variance, np.array([1, 0]), bounds=bounds, constraints=cons).x\nsolution = solution[0] + solution[1]", "solution": 2.42049326472743e-09}
