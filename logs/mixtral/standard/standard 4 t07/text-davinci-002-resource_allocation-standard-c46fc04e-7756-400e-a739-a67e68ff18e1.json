{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "output": "\nTo minimize the cost, we need to consider the total cost for each week and find the minimum cost among all the weeks. Here's the Python code that can solve this problem:\n```python\ndef calculate_cost(rentals, weeks):\n    total_cost = 0\n    for week in range(weeks):\n        weekly_cost = 0\n        for rental in rentals:\n            if rental <= 0:\n                continue\n            if week+1 + rental > weeks:\n                rental = weeks - week\n            weekly_cost += 220 * rental + 500\n        total_cost += weekly_cost\n    return total_cost\n\ndef find_min_cost(rentals, max_weeks):\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n    for i in range(1, max_weeks-3):\n        cost = calculate_cost(rentals, i)\n        for j in range(1, 4):\n            cost += calculate_cost(rentals[j:], max_weeks-i-j)\n        if cost < min_cost:\n            min_cost = cost\n    return min_cost\n\nrentals = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nmax_weeks = 4\nsolution = find_min_cost(rentals, max_weeks)\n```\nIn this code, we define a function `calculate_cost` that calculates the total cost for a given week, given the current rentals. Then, we define a function `find_min_cost` that calculates the minimum cost for all possible combinations of weeks. The `solution` variable is assigned the minimum cost found by `find_min_cost`.\n\nNote that the code assumes that the `rentals` variable is a list of integers representing the number of rental cars for each of the 4 weeks. The `max_weeks` variable represents the maximum number of weeks for which the cost needs to be calculated. The code assumes that Luxor Travel can only keep the rentals for an additional week, so the range of weeks to consider is from 1 to `max_weeks-3`. The code calculates the cost for all possible combinations of weeks, and returns the minimum cost found.", "code": "def calculate_cost(rentals, weeks):\n    total_cost = 0\n    for week in range(weeks):\n        weekly_cost = 0\n        for rental in rentals:\n            if rental <= 0:\n                continue\n            if week+1 + rental > weeks:\n                rental = weeks - week\n            weekly_cost += 220 * rental + 500\n        total_cost += weekly_cost\n    return total_cost\n\ndef find_min_cost(rentals, max_weeks):\n    min_cost = float('inf')\n    for i in range(1, max_weeks-3):\n        cost = calculate_cost(rentals, i)\n        for j in range(1, 4):\n            cost += calculate_cost(rentals[j:], max_weeks-i-j)\n        if cost < min_cost:\n            min_cost = cost\n    return min_cost\n\nrentals = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nmax_weeks = 4\nsolution = find_min_cost(rentals, max_weeks)", "solution": Infinity}
