Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "output": "\nThis problem can be solved using graph theory and set theory concepts. Each employee can be considered a node, and the projects they work on can be considered as edges connecting those nodes. The objective is to minimize the number of unique nodes (employees) present in each group meeting. We can solve this problem using the concept of a clique (a complete subgraph), which is a subset of vertices (employees) such that every two distinct vertices (employees) in the subset are adjacent (work on a shared project). The problem can be solved using the Bron-Kerbosch clique finding algorithm, and the maximum clique will represent the minimum number of employees needed in a meeting.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef max_clique(G):\n    def bron_kerbosch(R, P, X):\n        if not P and not R:\n            return X\n        clique = []\n        for v in R:\n            R.remove(v)\n            C = bron_kerbosch(R.intersection(P), R.intersection(P).intersection(G[v]),\n                             X.intersection(G[v]))\n            if C:\n                clique.append(v)\n                clique.extend(C)\n                return clique\n\n    G = {v: set(w for w in wset if v in wset) for v, wset in enumerate(G)}\n    return max(bron_kerbosch(R, R, X) for R in list(G.keys()) if R)\n\n# Employees and their respective projects\nemployees = [\n    [2, 4, 5],\n    [1, 3, 5],\n    [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    [3, 4, 5],\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    [1, 3, 4],\n    [5, 6],\n    [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n]\n\n# Create a graph using employees and their projects\ngraph = []\nfor employee in employees:\n    node = []\n    for i in range(len(employee)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(employee)):\n            if employee[i] != employee[j]:\n                node.append([i, j])\n    graph.append(node)\n\n# Calculate the maximum clique\nsolution = len(max_clique(graph))\n```\n\nIn this code, the `max_clique` function finds the maximum clique in the graph using the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.
