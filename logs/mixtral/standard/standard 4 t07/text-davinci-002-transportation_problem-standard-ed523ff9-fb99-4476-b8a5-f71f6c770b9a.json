Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow.

We can minimize the cost of purchasing home brew from Dick and Harry, subject to the constraints of Tom's thirst requirements and the maximum amount each person is willing to sell.\nHere's the Python code using the pulp library to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the decision variables\ntodays_pints_Dick = pulp.LpVariable('Todays_Pints_Dick', lowBound=0, upBound=5, cat='Continuous')\ntodays_pints_Harry = pulp.LpVariable('Todays_Pints_Harry', lowBound=0, upBound=4, cat='Continuous')\ntomorrows_pints_Dick = pulp.LpVariable('Tomorrows_Pints_Dick', lowBound=0, upBound=5-todays_pints_Dick, cat='Continuous')\ntomorrows_pints_Harry = pulp.LpVariable('Tomorrows_Pints_Harry', lowBound=0, upBound=4-todays_pints_Harry, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the objective function (minimize cost)\nprob = pulp.LpProblem('Home_Brew_Problem', pulp.LpMinimize)\ncost = (3*todays_pints_Dick + 2.9*todays_pints_Harry + 2.7*(5-todays_pints_Dick) + 2.8*(4-todays_pints_Harry))\nprob += cost\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += todays_pints_Dick + todays_pints_Harry == 3  # Tom's thirst requirements today\nprob += (5-todays_pints_Dick) + (4-todays_pints_Harry) >= 4  # Tom's thirst requirements tomorrow\nprob += todays_pints_Dick <= 5  # Maximum amount Dick is willing to sell today\nprob += todays_pints_Harry <= 4  # Maximum amount Harry is willing to sell today\nprob += (5-todays_pints_Dick) <= 5  # Maximum amount Dick is willing to sell tomorrow\nprob += (4-todays_pints_Harry) <= 4  # Maximum amount Harry is willing to sell tomorrow\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Assign the final output\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n```\nThe output of this code will be the minimum cost for Tom to satisfy his thirst requirements.
