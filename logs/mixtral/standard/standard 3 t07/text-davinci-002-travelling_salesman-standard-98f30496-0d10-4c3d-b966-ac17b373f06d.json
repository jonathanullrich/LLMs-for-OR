Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "output": "\nThe problem can be solved using graph theory and set theory concepts. We can represent the projects each employee works on as a set, and then use this information to form a graph where each node represents an employee and an edge between two employees exists if they share at least one project. Our aim is to partition the graph into cliques (groups of fully connected nodes) such that the sum of the sizes of the largest and second largest cliques is minimized.\n\nHere's a Python code to solve this problem using the networkx library for graph theory and the clique_partition library for clique partitioning:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom clique_partition import find_cliques, CliquePartition\n\n# Define the employees and their respective projects\nemployees = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprojects = [2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 2, 5, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Create a graph based on shared projects\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_nodes_from(employees)\nfor i in range(len(employees)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(employees)):\n        if set(projects[i*6:i*6+6]).intersection(projects[j*6:j*6+6]):\n            G.add_edge(employees[i], employees[j])\n\n# Partition the graph into cliques\ncp = CliquePartition(G)\ncliques = list(cp)\n\n# Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\nsolution = max(len(clique) for clique in cliques) + min(len(clique) for clique in cliques)\n```\n\nThe variable `solution` will hold the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "code": "import networkx as nx\nfrom clique_partition import find_cliques, CliquePartition\n\n# Define the employees and their respective projects\nemployees = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprojects = [2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 1, 2, 5, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n\n# Create a graph based on shared projects\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_nodes_from(employees)\nfor i in range(len(employees)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(employees)):\n        if set(projects[i*6:i*6+6]).intersection(projects[j*6:j*6+6]):\n            G.add_edge(employees[i], employees[j])\n\n# Partition the graph into cliques\ncp = CliquePartition(G)\ncliques = list(cp)\n\n# Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\nsolution = max(len(clique) for clique in cliques) + min(len(clique) for clique in cliques)", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
