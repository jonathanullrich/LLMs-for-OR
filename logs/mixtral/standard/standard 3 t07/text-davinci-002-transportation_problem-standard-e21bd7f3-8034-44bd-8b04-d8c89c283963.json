Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can use linear programming to minimize the cost of purchasing home brew from Dick and Harry. The decision variables in this problem are x (amount of home brew purchased from Dick today) and y (amount of home brew purchased from Harry today). The objective function and constraints can be written as follows:\n\nMinimize:\n3x + 2.9y (cost of purchasing home brew from Dick and Harry today)\n\nSubject to:\nx + y = 3 (Tom's thirst requirement today)\nx <= 5 (Dick's maximum capacity)\ny <= 4 (Harry's maximum capacity)\nx >= 0, y >= 0 (non-negativity constraint)\n\nWe can use the `pulp` library to solve this linear programming problem:\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Define the decision variables\nx = pulp.LpVariable('x', lowBound=0, upBound=5, cat='Continuous')\ny = pulp.LpVariable('y', lowBound=0, upBound=4, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob = pulp.LpProblem('HomeBrew', pulp.LpMinimize)\nprob += 3*x + 2.9*y\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += x + y == 3\nprob += x <= 5\nprob += y <= 4\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Get the optimal solution\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f'The optimal cost of purchasing home brew is ${solution:.2f}.')\n```\n\nThe output of the program is:\n\n```\nThe optimal cost of purchasing home brew is $8.70.\n```\n\nSo the value of the variable 'solution' is $8.70, which means that Tom can minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements by purchasing 0 pints from Dick today and 3 pints from Harry today. He will then purchase the remaining 4 pints from Harry tomorrow.", "code": "import pulp\n\n# Define the decision variables\nx = pulp.LpVariable('x', lowBound=0, upBound=5, cat='Continuous')\ny = pulp.LpVariable('y', lowBound=0, upBound=4, cat='Continuous')\n\n# Define the objective function\nprob = pulp.LpProblem('HomeBrew', pulp.LpMinimize)\nprob += 3*x + 2.9*y\n\n# Define the constraints\nprob += x + y == 3\nprob += x <= 5\nprob += y <= 4\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Get the optimal solution\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f'The optimal cost of purchasing home brew is ${solution:.2f}.')", "solution": 8.7}
