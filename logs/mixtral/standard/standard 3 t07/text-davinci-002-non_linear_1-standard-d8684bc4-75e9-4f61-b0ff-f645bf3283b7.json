{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "output": "\n\nHere is a Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef tax_revenue(t):\n    consumption = max(53 - 100 * (t / 100), 0)\n    revenue = consumption * (base_price + t / 100)\n    return revenue\n\nbase_price = 0.15\nt_max = 100\nstep = 1\n\nmax_revenue = 0\noptimal_tax_rate = 0\n\nfor t in range(0, t_max + 1, step):\n    revenue = tax_revenue(t)\n    if revenue > max_revenue:\n        max_revenue = revenue\n        optimal_tax_rate = t\n\nsolution = optimal_tax_rate\n```\nThe code defines a function `tax_revenue` that calculates the tax revenue for a given tax rate `t`. It then iterates through possible tax rates from 0 to 100 cents with a step size of 1 cent. For each tax rate, it calculates the tax revenue and updates the maximum revenue and the optimal tax rate if the current revenue is higher than the previous maximum. Finally, it assigns the optimal tax rate to the variable `solution`.", "code": "def tax_revenue(t):\n    consumption = max(53 - 100 * (t / 100), 0)\n    revenue = consumption * (base_price + t / 100)\n    return revenue\n\nbase_price = 0.15\nt_max = 100\nstep = 1\n\nmax_revenue = 0\noptimal_tax_rate = 0\n\nfor t in range(0, t_max + 1, step):\n    revenue = tax_revenue(t)\n    if revenue > max_revenue:\n        max_revenue = revenue\n        optimal_tax_rate = t\n\nsolution = optimal_tax_rate", "solution": 19}
