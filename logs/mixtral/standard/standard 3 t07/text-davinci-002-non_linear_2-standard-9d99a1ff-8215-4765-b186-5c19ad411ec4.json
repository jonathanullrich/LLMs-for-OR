The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.", "output": "\nTo solve this problem, we can calculate the distance between the potential optimum location and each of the six airfields, and then sum up the distances for each potential location. We can then iterate over all possible coordinates for the potential optimum location, excluding the swamp and lake areas, and find the minimum total distance. Here's the code to do that:\n```python\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    return ((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2)**0.5\n\ndef is_valid_location(x, y):\n    if x + y >= 250 or (x - 100)**2 + (y - 100)**2 <= 400:\n        return False\n    return True\n\nmin_total_distance = float('inf')\nsolution = None\nfor x in range(1, 250):\n    for y in range(1, 250):\n        if is_valid_location(x, y):\n            total_distance = sum([distance(x, y, a_x, a_y) for a_x, a_y in [(40, 200), (160, 210), (250, 160), (220, 80), (100, 40), (30, 100)]])\n            if total_distance < min_total_distance:\n                min_total_distance = total_distance\n                solution = min_total_distance\nprint(solution)\n```\nWhen you run this code, it will print the minimum total distance, which is the objective function value of the optimal location.", "code": "def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    return ((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2)**0.5\n\ndef is_valid_location(x, y):\n    if x + y >= 250 or (x - 100)**2 + (y - 100)**2 <= 400:\n        return False\n    return True\n\nmin_total_distance = float('inf')\nsolution = None\nfor x in range(1, 250):\n    for y in range(1, 250):\n        if is_valid_location(x, y):\n            total_distance = sum([distance(x, y, a_x, a_y) for a_x, a_y in [(40, 200), (160, 210), (250, 160), (220, 80), (100, 40), (30, 100)]])\n            if total_distance < min_total_distance:\n                min_total_distance = total_distance\n                solution = min_total_distance\nprint(solution)", "solution": 627.2728138649978}
