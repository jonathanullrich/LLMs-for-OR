    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "output": "The given problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem, where Luxor Travel needs to determine the number of cars to rent each week in order to minimize the total rental cost. Here is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Rental cost per car per week\nrental_cost_per_car = 220\n\n# Flat fee for any rental transaction\nflat_fee = 500\n\n# Number of cars needed each week\ncars_needed = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n\n# Initialize the dynamic programming table\ndp = np.zeros((len(cars_needed) + 1, max(cars_needed) + 1))\n\n# Fill the dynamic programming table\nfor week in range(len(cars_needed) - 1, -1, -1):\n    for cars in range(max(cars_needed[week], cars_needed[week - 1]) + 1):\n        if week == len(cars_needed) - 1:\n            dp[week][cars] = cars * rental_cost_per_car + flat_fee\n        else:\n            dp[week][cars] = min((cars * rental_cost_per_car + flat_fee) + dp[week + 1][max(cars - cars_needed[week], 0)], dp[week + 1][cars_needed[week]] + (max(cars_needed[week], cars) * rental_cost_per_car))\n\n# The minimum cost is the cost for the first week\nsolution = int(dp[0][cars_needed[0]])\n```\n\nIn this code, the dynamic programming table `dp` is filled in a bottom-up manner. For each week, Luxor Travel has two options: either to rent new cars for the next week or to keep the rentals for an additional week. The cost of the first option is the rental fee for the new cars plus the flat fee, and the cost of the second option is the rental fee for the current cars. The minimum cost is then computed by comparing the costs of these two options.",
