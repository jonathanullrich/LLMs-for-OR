    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",
    "output": "This problem can be solved using linear programming to minimize risk (variance) subject to a return constraint. The cvxpy library can be used to formulate and solve the optimization problem in Python. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```python\nimport cvxpy as cvx\n\n# prices per block\np1 = 20\np2 = 30\n\n# expected returns per block\nr1 = 5\nr2 = 10\n\n# variances of returns per block\nvar1 = 4\nvar2 = 100\n\n# covariance of returns\ncov12 = 5\n\n# target return\ntarget_r = 0.15 * 50000 # 15% of 50,000\n\n# decision variables\nx1 = cvx.Variable() # number of blocks of stock 1\nx2 = cvx.Variable() # number of blocks of stock 2\n\n# objective function\nrisk = var1*x1**2 + var2*x2**2 + 2*cov12*x1*x2\nobjective = cvx.Minimize(risk)\n\n# constraints\nconstraints = [x1*p1 + x2*p2 <= 50000, # total investment <= 50,000\n               r1*x1 + r2*x2 >= target_r, # expected return >= target return\n               x1 >= 0,\n               x2 >= 0]\n\n# problem\nproblem = cvx.Problem(objective, constraints)\n\n# solve\nproblem.solve()\n\nsolution = x1.value*p1 + x2.value*p2\n```\n\nThis script creates a cvxpy problem to minimize the variance of the portfolio (risk) subject to constraints on the total investment and the target return. It then solves the problem and assigns the minimum investment required to achieve the target return to the variable 'solution'. Note that the problem may not have a solution if the target return is not feasible given the constraints.",
