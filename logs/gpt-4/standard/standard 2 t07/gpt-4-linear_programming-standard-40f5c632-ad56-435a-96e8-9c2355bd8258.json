    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?",
    "output": "Sure, this is an integer linear programming problem where the variables are integer, and the constraints are linear. We can solve this problem using the PuLP library in python. Here is the python code.\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Create a problem variable\nprob = LpProblem(\"Maximize Profit\", LpMaximize)\n\n# Create variable for product 1\nx1 = LpVariable(\"Product 1\", 0, None, LpInteger)\n\n# Create variable for product 2\nx2 = LpVariable(\"Product 2\", 0, 60, LpInteger) # upper bound is 60\n\n# Objective function\nprob += x1 + 2*x2, \"Total Profit\"\n\n# Constraints\nprob += x1 + 3*x2 <= 200, \"Frame Parts\"\nprob += 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300, \"Electrical Components\"\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\n```\nThe `solution` variable will contain the maximum profit that can be achieved. Please note that you will need to install the PuLP library to run this code, which can be done via pip: `pip install pulp`.",
