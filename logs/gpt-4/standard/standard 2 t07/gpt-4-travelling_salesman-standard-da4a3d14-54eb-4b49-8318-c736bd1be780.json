    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",
    "output": "The problem statement requires an approach that minimizes the traffic of employees in and out of the meeting room. This problem can be solved using the concept of graph theory where employees and projects can be represented as nodes and edges respectively.\n\nIn this case, the problem can be reduced to finding the minimum number of colorings required for the graph, where each color represents a meeting. This is a version of the graph coloring problem, which is known to be NP-hard.\n\nSince we are asked to provide a Python solution, here is a Python program that uses a greedy approach to solve a version of the graph coloring problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_number_of_meetings(graph):\n    result = [-1] * len(graph)\n    result[0] = 0\n    available = [False] * len(graph)\n    for u in range(1, len(graph)):\n        for i in graph[u]:\n            if result[i] != -1:\n                available[result[i]] = True\n        clr = 0\n        while True:\n            if available[clr] == False:\n                break\n            clr += 1\n        result[u] = clr\n        for i in graph[u]:\n            if result[i] != -1:\n                available[result[i]] = False\n    return max(result) + 1\n\ngraph = [[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], [0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9], [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9], [2, 4, 5, 7, 8], [0, 1, 3, 8, 9], [0, 2, 3, 6, 7], [1, 2, 5, 7, 9], [0, 1, 3, 5, 6], [0, 3, 4], [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]]\nsolution = min_number_of_meetings(graph)\n```\n\nThis code first initializes an array `result` to hold the color assigned to each vertex. `available` is a boolean array that stores which colors are available. For each vertex, it considers its adjacent vertices and marks their colors as unavailable. Then it finds the first available color and assigns it to the current vertex. After assigning the color, it again marks all the colors of the adjacent vertices as available for the next iteration.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the employees and projects are numbered starting from 0 and that the graph provided is an adjacency list representation of the graph where each index represents an employee and the list at that index represents the projects that the employee is working on. \n\nThe final 'solution' variable represents the minimum number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room. This solution may not be the absolute minimum possible as the graph coloring problem is NP-Hard and this is a greedy approach.",
