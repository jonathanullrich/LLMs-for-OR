    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.",
    "output": "The problem can be considered as a knapsack problem which can be solved using dynamic programming. The python code for is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef knapSack(W, wt, val, n):\n    K = [[0 for w in range(W + 1)]\n            for i in range(n + 1)]\n             \n    # Build table K[][] in bottom\n    # up manner\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        for w in range(W + 1):\n            if i == 0 or w == 0:\n                K[i][w] = 0\n            elif wt[i - 1] <= w:\n                K[i][w] = max(val[i - 1]\n                  + K[i - 1][w - wt[i - 1]],\n                               K[i - 1][w])\n            else:\n                K[i][w] = K[i - 1][w]\n \n    return K[n][W]\n \n# Driver code\nval = [30, 50, 70]\nwt = [2, 3, 4]\nW = 5\nn = len(val)\n \nsolution = knapSack(W, wt, val, n)\n```\n\nHere in the function `knapSack()` we are finding the maximum total value we can get by considering all the items and their volumes. The `knapSack()` function takes the maximum capacity of the backpack, the volumes of the items, their respective values, and the total number of items as input, and it returns the maximum value the hiker can get.\n\nIn the driver code, we are calling the `knapSack()` function with the given values and volumes of the items and the capacity of the backpack, and storing the returned maximum value in the variable 'solution'.",
