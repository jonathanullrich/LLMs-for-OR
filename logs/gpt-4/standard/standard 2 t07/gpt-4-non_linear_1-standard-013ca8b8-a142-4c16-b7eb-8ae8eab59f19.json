    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
    "output": "The tax revenue is the product of the tax per cigarette, the number of cigarettes sold, and the number of smokers. The number of smokers is assumed to be constant. The tax per cigarette is t * base price. The number of cigarettes sold is given by the consumption function. Hence, the tax revenue function R(t) can be written as:\n\nR(t) = f(t) * t * base_price.\n\nThis is a quadratic function, and its maximum can be found by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero. However, we need to keep in mind that the tax rate t must be between 0 and 100. \n\nLet's write this as a python code.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# define the variables\nt = sp.symbols('t')\n\n# define the base price\nbase_price = 0.15\n\n# define the consumption function\nf = 53 - 100*(t/100)\n\n# define the revenue function\nR = f * t * base_price\n\n# calculate the derivative of the revenue function\nR_prime = sp.diff(R, t)\n\n# find the critical points by setting the derivative equal to zero\ncritical_points = sp.solve(R_prime, t)\n\n# only consider the critical points that are within the domain [0, 100]\ncritical_points = [point.evalf() for point in critical_points if 0 <= point <= 100]\n\n# calculate the revenue at the critical points and at the endpoints of the domain\nrevenues = [R.subs(t, point).evalf() for point in [0, 100] + critical_points]\n\n# find the tax rate that maximizes the revenue\nsolution = critical_points[revenues.index(max(revenues))]\n```\n\nThis code calculates the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
