    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",
    "output": "In this case, we can formulate the problem as a Linear Programming problem. We will use the `pulp` library in Python to solve this problem.\n\nHere, the decision variables are the number of pints Tom buys from Dick and Harry on each day. The objective function to minimize is the total cost of the pints bought. And the constraints are the total number of pints bought each day and the maximum pints each person is willing to sell.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport pulp\n\n# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data\nprob = pulp.LpProblem(\"Beer Buying Problem\", pulp.LpMinimize)\n\n# Create decision variables\nd1 = pulp.LpVariable('d1', lowBound=0, cat='Integer') # pints bought from Dick on day 1\nd2 = pulp.LpVariable('d2', lowBound=0, cat='Integer') # pints bought from Dick on day 2\nh1 = pulp.LpVariable('h1', lowBound=0, cat='Integer') # pints bought from Harry on day 1\nh2 = pulp.LpVariable('h2', lowBound=0, cat='Integer') # pints bought from Harry on day 2\n\n# Objective function\nprob += 3.00*d1 + 2.70*d2 + 2.90*h1 + 2.80*h2, \"Total Cost\"\n\n# Constraints\nprob += d1 + h1 == 3, \"Total pints on day 1\"\nprob += d2 + h2 == 4, \"Total pints on day 2\"\nprob += d1 + d2 <= 5, \"Maximum pints from Dick\"\nprob += h1 + h2 <= 4, \"Maximum pints from Harry\"\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\nsolution = pulp.value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nThis code would give the minimum cost that Tom needs to pay to satisfy his thirst requirements. 'solution' contains the minimum cost.",
