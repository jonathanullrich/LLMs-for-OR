    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A Postman has to walk through each street at least once when delivering letters. He must start and end at Point A. He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.",
    "output": "The problem is a variant of the Chinese Postman Problem (also known as Route Inspection Problem), where we want to find the shortest possible route that visits each edge of a graph at least once. We can solve this problem using graph theory and network algorithms.\n\nPython has a library called NetworkX that allows us to create, manipulate, and study the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. We can use it to solve our problem.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Create an empty graph\nG = nx.MultiGraph()\n\n# Add edges to the graph (street connections)\nG.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('A', 'C', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('B', 'C', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('B', 'D', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('D', 'E', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('D', 'F', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('E', 'F', weight=9)\nG.add_edge('E', 'G', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('F', 'G', weight=5)\nG.add_edge('G', 'H', weight=3)\n\n# Find the shortest route that visits each edge at least once\nroute = nx.greedy_tsp(G, source='A')\n\n# Calculate the total length of the route\nsolution = sum(G[u][v][0]['weight'] for u, v in nx.utils.pairwise(route))\n\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nPlease replace the code's print statement with `solution`. The variable `solution` should contain the minimal length to walk through all the streets.",
