    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
    "output": "Assuming that the tax revenue is calculated as the product of tax rate, base price per cigarette and the average daily consumption, we can express the tax revenue as a function of tax rate t:\n\nR(t) = t * 0.15 * (53 - 100*(t/100))\n\nThis is a quadratic function of t, and its maximum value can be found by computing the derivative and setting it to zero. Then, the tax rate that maximizes the revenue can be found by solving this equation.\n\nHere is a Python code that calculates the solution:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nt = sp.symbols('t')\n\n# Define the revenue function\nR = t * 0.15 * (53 - t)\n\n# Compute the derivative\nR_prime = sp.diff(R, t)\n\n# Find the tax rate that maximizes the revenue\nsolution = sp.solve(R_prime, t)[0]\n\nsolution\n```\n\nThis code uses the sympy library to perform symbolic computation. It first defines the variable t, then defines the revenue function R as a function of t. It then computes the derivative of R with respect to t, and finally solves the equation R_prime = 0 for t. The result is the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
