    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "output": "To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. \n\nThe state of our dynamic programming solution will be `(week, cars)`, which represents the week we are in and the number of cars we currently have.\n\nThe transition from one state to another will depend on whether we decide to keep the rental cars for another week or return them and rent new cars. If we decide to keep the cars, the cost will be the rental fee for the cars we currently have plus the rental fee for the additional cars we need. If we decide to return the cars and rent new cars, the cost will be the rental fee for the new cars plus the flat fee for the rental transaction.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef min_cost(weeks, cars, rental_fee, flat_fee):\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * 101 for _ in range(len(weeks) + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    for i in range(len(weeks)):\n        for j in range(101):\n            for k in range(max(j, weeks[i]), 101):\n                cost = dp[i][j] + (k - j) * rental_fee + flat_fee * (j < k)\n                dp[i + 1][k] = min(dp[i + 1][k], cost)\n    return min(dp[len(weeks)])\n\nweeks = [7, 4, 7, 8]\ncars = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nrental_fee = 220\nflat_fee = 500\nsolution = min_cost(weeks, cars, rental_fee, flat_fee)\n```\n\nThis code first initializes the dynamic programming table `dp` with infinity for all states except the initial state `(0, 0)`. Then it iterates over all weeks and for each week, it iterates over all possible numbers of cars we can have. For each state, it calculates the minimal cost to transition to this state from any previous state and updates the dynamic programming table accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimal cost to satisfy all rental needs.",
    "code": "def min_cost(weeks, cars, rental_fee, flat_fee):\n    dp = [[float('inf')] * 101 for _ in range(len(weeks) + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    for i in range(len(weeks)):\n        for j in range(101):\n            for k in range(max(j, weeks[i]), 101):\n                cost = dp[i][j] + (k - j) * rental_fee + flat_fee * (j < k)\n                dp[i + 1][k] = min(dp[i + 1][k], cost)\n    return min(dp[len(weeks)])\n\nweeks = [7, 4, 7, 8]\ncars = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nrental_fee = 220\nflat_fee = 500\nsolution = min_cost(weeks, cars, rental_fee, flat_fee)",
