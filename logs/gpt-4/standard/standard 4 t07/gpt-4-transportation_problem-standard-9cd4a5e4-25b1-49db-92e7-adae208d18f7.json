    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",
    "output": "Given the problem, we can try to minimize the cost using linear programming. Here is the python code for it:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the coefficients of the inequalities\nA = [[-1, -1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, -1, -1],\n     [-1, 0, -1, 0],\n     [0, -1, 0, -1]]\n\n# Define the RHS of the inequalities\nb = [-3, -4, -5, -4]\n\n# Define the coefficients of the objective function\nc = [3, 2.7, 2.9, 2.8]\n\n# Solve the linear programming problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, method='simplex')\n\n# The optimal solution\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nIn the problem, the variables are the number of pints bought today and tomorrow from both Dick and Harry. The objective function is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the cost of pints bought from both Dick and Harry today and tomorrow. The constraints are that Tom wants to buy 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow, and Dick can sell at most 5 pints and Harry can sell at most 4 pints.\n\nThe 'solution' variable will give us the minimum cost that Tom needs to spend in order to satisfy his thirst requirements.",
