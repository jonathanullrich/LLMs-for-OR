    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.",
    "output": "We will find the total profit by adding the profit from each product. For this, we will first find the optimal production rate for each product. As per the problem, the sum of R1 and R2 cannot exceed 2. Additionally, since the marginal profit is decreasing for both products, the optimal production rate for each product will be at the point where the derivative of their respective profit functions are zero.\n\nThe derivative of the profit function for Product 1 is 200 - 200*R1 and for Product 2 is 300 - 200*R2. Setting these to zero gives the optimal production rates as R1 = 1 and R2 = 1.5. However, since the total production rate cannot exceed 2, we will have to adjust these values. \n\nWe can do this by equating the marginal profits of two products at the point where their sum is equal to 2. That gives us the equation: 200 - 200*R1 = 300 - 200*(2 - R1). Solving this equation gives us R1 = 0.5 and R2 = 1.5.\n\nFinally, we substitute these values in the profit functions of each product to get the total profit.\n\nHere is the python code to solve this:\n\n```python\n# production rates\nR1 = 0.5\nR2 = 1.5\n\n# profit functions\nprofit1 = 200*R1 - 100*R1**2\nprofit2 = 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\n\n# total profit\nsolution = profit1 + profit2\n```\n\nRunning this code will give the solution.",
