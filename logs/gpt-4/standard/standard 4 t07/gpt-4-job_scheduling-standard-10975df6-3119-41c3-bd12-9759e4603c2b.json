    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",
    "output": "The problem appears to be a scheduling problem. It can be solved using a priority queue, where the jobs with the earliest deadlines are given higher priority. Here is a Python code that does exactly that.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Create a list of jobs with their processing times and deadlines\njobs = [(6, 8), (4, 4), (5, 12), (8, 16)]\n\n# Sort the jobs in increasing order of their deadlines\njobs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n# Initialize the total processing time and the priority queue\ntotal_time = 0\nqueue = []\n\n# Process the jobs in the order of their deadlines\nfor job in jobs:\n    heapq.heappush(queue, -job[0])\n    total_time += job[0]\n\n    # If the total processing time exceeds the deadline of the current job,\n    # remove the job with the longest processing time from the queue\n    while total_time > job[1]:\n        total_time += heapq.heappop(queue)\n\n# The total processing time is the minimal time to process all jobs\nsolution = total_time\n```\n\nThis code first sorts the jobs based on their deadlines. Then, it processes the jobs one by one. If processing a job would cause the total processing time to exceed the deadline of the current job, it removes the job with the longest processing time from the queue. The total processing time at the end is the minimal time to process all jobs.",
