    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The optimum location is sought for an airfield from which the six airfields A to F can be approached. The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.",
    "output": "First, we need to set up the problem. The problem is to minimize the sum of the daily flight kilometers. We can use a mathematical optimization library such as scipy to solve this problem.\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coordinates and number of flights\nairfields = {\n    'A': {'coords': (40, 200), 'flights': 40},\n    'B': {'coords': (160, 210), 'flights': 10},\n    'C': {'coords': (250, 160), 'flights': 20},\n    'D': {'coords': (220, 80), 'flights': 30},\n    'E': {'coords': (100, 40), 'flights': 20},\n    'F': {'coords': (30, 100), 'flights': 10}\n}\n\n# Objective function\ndef objective(x):\n    total_distance = 0\n    for airfield in airfields.values():\n        distance = np.sqrt((x[0] - airfield['coords'][0])**2 + (x[1] - airfield['coords'][1])**2)\n        total_distance += distance * airfield['flights']\n    return total_distance\n\n# Constraints\ndef swamp_constraint(x):\n    return 250 - (x[0] + x[1])\n\ndef lake_constraint(x):\n    return 400 - ((x[0] - 100)**2 + (x[1] - 100)**2)\n\nconstraints = [\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': swamp_constraint},\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lake_constraint}\n]\n\n# Initial guess\nx0 = np.array([100, 100])\n\n# Solve the problem\nresult = minimize(objective, x0, constraints=constraints)\n\n# Print the result\nsolution = result.fun\n```\n\nThis script sets up the objective function and the constraints, and then uses the scipy.optimize.minimize function to find the minimum of the objective function subject to the constraints. The result is stored in the variable 'solution'. The actual value of 'solution' will depend on the exact distances and number of flights.\n\nPlease note that the result obtained from the scipy's minimize method may not be the global minimum, as the method could get stuck in a local minimum depending on the complexity of the problem and the initial guess.\n\nAlso, the code does not check if the optimal location is within the feasible region defined by the x and y coordinates. If the optimal location is not within the feasible region, additional constraints may need to be added to the problem, or a different optimization method may need to be used.",
