    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",
    "output": "The problem can be solved using quadratic programming since it involves the optimization of a quadratic function subject to linear constraints. We want to minimize the risk (variance of the portfolio) subject to a constraint on the expected return.\n\nWe can use the cvxpy library in python to solve this.\n\n```python\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n# Constants\ntotal_investment = 50\nprices = [20, 30]  # price per block\nreturns = [5, 10]  # expected return per block\nvariances = [4, 100]  # variance per block\ncovariance = 5  # covariance\n\n# Variables\nx = cp.Variable(2, nonneg=True)  # number of blocks of each stock\n\n# Objective function\nrisk = variances[0]*x[0]**2 + variances[1]*x[1]**2 + 2*covariance*x[0]*x[1]\nobjective = cp.Minimize(risk)\n\n# Constraints\nconstraints = [\n    cp.sum(x*prices) <= total_investment,  # total investment constraint\n    cp.sum(x*returns) >= total_investment*0.15,  # expected return constraint\n]\n\n# Problem\nprob = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\n\n# Solve\nprob.solve()\n\n# Calculate the minimum amount to invest\nmin_investment = cp.sum(x.value*prices).value\nsolution = round(min_investment, 2)\n\nprint('The minimum amount Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent is $', solution*1000)\n```\n\nThis code will output the minimum amount Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent, where the risk is minimized. The risk is given by the sum of the variances of the stocks and their covariance, weighted by the number of blocks of each stock. The constraints ensure that the total investment does not exceed the available funds and that the expected return is at least 15 percent.\n\nPlease note that the final answer should be multiplied by 1000 to convert from units of 1000 dollars to dollars. The solution is rounded to 2 decimal places for readability.",
