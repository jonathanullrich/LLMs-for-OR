    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",
    "output": "In order to solve this problem, we can use a graph theory approach. We can represent each employee as a node in a graph, and draw an edge between any two nodes if they share at least one project. The problem then becomes finding an optimal ordering of the nodes that minimizes the total number of edges crossed.\n\nThis problem is known as the minimum linear arrangement problem, and it is NP-hard. However, we can use a heuristic approach to find a good solution. One such approach is the simulated annealing algorithm. Here is a Python code that uses the simulated annealing method to find a solution.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport math\n\n# Define the projects for each employee\nprojects = {\n    1: {2, 4, 5},\n    2: {1, 3, 5},\n    3: {2, 3, 4, 6},\n    4: {3, 4, 5},\n    5: {1, 2, 3},\n    6: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6},\n    7: {1, 2, 5, 6},\n    8: {1, 3, 4},\n    9: {5, 6},\n    10: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6},\n}\n\n# Calculate the number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room for a given arrangement\ndef calculate_traffic(arrangement):\n    traffic = 0\n    for i in range(len(arrangement)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arrangement)):\n            if projects[arrangement[i]] & projects[arrangement[j]]:\n                traffic += 1\n    return traffic\n\n# Initial solution (random order)\nsolution = list(projects.keys())\nrandom.shuffle(solution)\nbest_traffic = calculate_traffic(solution)\n\n# Simulated annealing parameters\nT = 10.0  # Initial temperature\nT_min = 0.001  # Minimum temperature\nalpha = 0.9  # Cooling rate\n\nwhile T > T_min:\n    i, j = random.sample(range(10), 2)  # Pick two employees randomly\n    solution[i], solution[j] = solution[j], solution[i]  # Swap them\n    traffic = calculate_traffic(solution)\n    if traffic < best_traffic or random.random() < math.exp((best_traffic - traffic) / T):\n        best_traffic = traffic  # Accept the new solution if it is better or with a certain probability if it is worse\n    else:\n        solution[i], solution[j] = solution[j], solution[i]  # Otherwise, revert the swap\n    T *= alpha  # Cool down\n\nsolution = best_traffic\n```\n\nThis python code will print the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",
