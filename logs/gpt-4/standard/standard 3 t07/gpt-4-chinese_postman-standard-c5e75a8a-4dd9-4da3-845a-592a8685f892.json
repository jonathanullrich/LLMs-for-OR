    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A Postman has to walk through each street at least once when delivering letters. He must start and end at Point A. He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.",
    "output": "This problem can be solved using the Chinese Postman Problem algorithm. Here is the Python code using Networkx library to solve this problem.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Create an empty multi-graph\nG = nx.MultiGraph()\n\n# Add edges to the graph\nG.add_edge('A', 'B', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('A', 'C', weight=2)\nG.add_edge('B', 'C', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('B', 'D', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('D', 'E', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('D', 'F', weight=4)\nG.add_edge('E', 'F', weight=9)\nG.add_edge('E', 'G', weight=3)\nG.add_edge('F', 'G', weight=5)\nG.add_edge('G', 'H', weight=3)\n\n# Find the shortest path that visits all edges\ncircuit = nx.eulerian_circuit(G, source='A')\n\n# Calculate the total length of the path\nsolution = sum(G[u][v][0]['weight'] for u, v in circuit)\n```\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the Networkx library is installed and that the graph is connected and has an Eulerian circuit (a path that visits every edge exactly once and starts and ends at the same vertex). If the graph does not have an Eulerian circuit, the Chinese Postman Problem is more complex and requires a different approach that involves duplicating certain edges.",
