    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.",
    "output": "Here is a Python code to solve the problem by using a simple approach:\n\n```python\n# Define the values and volumes of the items\nvalues = [30, 50, 70]\nvolumes = [2, 3, 4]\n\n# Initialize the maximum value and the optimal solution\nmax_value = 0\nsolution = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of items\nfor i in range(2):\n    for j in range(2):\n        for k in range(2):\n            # Calculate the total value and volume of the current combination\n            total_value = i*values[0] + j*values[1] + k*values[2]\n            total_volume = i*volumes[0] + j*volumes[1] + k*volumes[2]\n            # If the total volume does not exceed the capacity of the backpack and the total value is greater than the maximum value, update the maximum value and the optimal solution\n            if total_volume <= 5 and total_value > max_value:\n                max_value = total_value\n                solution = (i, j, k)\n\n# Print the optimal solution\nprint('The optimal solution is ', solution)\n```\n\nThis code will print the optimal solution as a tuple of 0s and 1s, where 1 indicates that the corresponding item is included in the backpack and 0 indicates that it is not. The items are ordered as they are in the `values` and `volumes` lists, so the first element of the tuple corresponds to the first item, the second element corresponds to the second item, and so on.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the items can only be taken once. If an item can be taken multiple times, the problem would be a unbounded knapsack problem, which would require a different approach to solve.",
