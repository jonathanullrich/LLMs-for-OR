    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",
    "output": "Sure, this problem can be solved using linear programming. Python provides a package named `scipy` which contains a method named `linprog` to solve linear programming problems.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the coefficients of the objective function\n# The goal is to minimize the cost, so we put coefficients as per the prices\nc = [3, 2.9, 2.7, 2.8]\n\n# Define the inequality constraints matrix\n# Each row corresponds to a seller's maximum limit\nA = [[1, 1, 0, 0], \n     [0, 0, 1, 1]]\n\n# Define the inequality constraints vector\n# Each element corresponds to the maximum limit of beer that each seller can sell\nb = [5, 4]\n\n# Define the equality constraints matrix\n# Each row corresponds to Tom's home brew requirements on each day\nA_eq = [[1, 1, 1, 1], \n        [-1, 0, 1, 0]]\n\n# Define the equality constraints vector\n# Each element corresponds to the exact amount of beer that Tom wants each day\nb_eq = [7, 1]\n\n# Define the bounds for each variable in the problem\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, None)\nx2_bounds = (0, None)\nx3_bounds = (0, None)\n\n# Use linprog to solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=b_eq, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds, x2_bounds, x3_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Print the optimal solution\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nThis code will give the minimum cost that Tom needs to pay in order to satisfy his thirst requirements. The `linprog` method returns an object which contains various information about the solution. We extract the minimum cost using `res.fun`.\n\nPlease note that the `linprog` function solves only linear problems. If your constraints or the objective function are not linear, this function cannot be used.",
