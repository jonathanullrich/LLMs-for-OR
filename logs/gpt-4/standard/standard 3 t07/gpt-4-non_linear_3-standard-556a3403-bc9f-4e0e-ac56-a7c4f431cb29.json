    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",
    "output": "The problem involves calculating the least amount of money that Ann needs to invest in order to achieve a return of 15 percent, given the prices, expected returns, and risk levels of two stocks. This is a convex optimization problem that can be solved using quadratic programming.\n\nWe can set up the problem as follows:\n\n1. Let x1 and x2 be the number of blocks of stock 1 and stock 2, respectively, that Ann needs to buy. \n2. We want to minimize the total cost of buying these stocks, which is 20*x1 + 30*x2.\n3. We have three constraints:\n    - The expected return should be at least 15 percent, i.e., 0.05*x1 + 0.1*x2 >= 0.15.\n    - The risk should be minimized, i.e., 4*x1^2 + 100*x2^2 + 2*5*x1*x2 <= a given risk level.\n    - Ann has at most $50,000 to invest, i.e., 20*x1 + 30*x2 <= 50.\n\nWe can use the cvxpy library in Python to solve this problem. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n# define variables\nx1 = cp.Variable()\nx2 = cp.Variable()\n\n# define constraints\nconstraints = [\n    0.05*x1 + 0.1*x2 >= 0.15,\n    4*x1**2 + 100*x2**2 + 10*x1*x2 <= 50,\n    20*x1 + 30*x2 <= 50,\n]\n\n# define objective\nobjective = cp.Minimize(20*x1 + 30*x2)\n\n# define problem\nproblem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\n\n# solve problem\nsolution = problem.solve()\n\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified model and actual investment decisions would need to take into account many other factors. Also, the risk constraint in the model might need to be adjusted based on Ann's risk tolerance level.",
