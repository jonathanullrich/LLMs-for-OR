    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
    "output": "First, we define the function for the average daily consumption per smoker given the tax rate. This is a linear function, where the slope is -100 and the y-intercept is 53. \n\nThen, we define the function for tax revenue. This is the product of the tax rate, the base price per cigarette, and the average daily consumption per smoker. \n\nWe want to find the tax rate that maximizes this function. To do this, we can use the scipy.optimize library in Python, which contains a minimize function. Since we want to maximize the tax revenue, we can minimize the negative of this function. \n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Define the function for the average daily consumption per smoker\ndef f(t):\n    return 53 - 100*(t/100)\n\n# Define the function for tax revenue\ndef tax_revenue(t):\n    return -t * 0.15 * f(t)\n\n# Set the initial guess for the tax rate\ninitial_guess = [0.1]\n\n# Minimize the negative of the tax revenue function\nresult = minimize(tax_revenue, initial_guess)\n\nsolution = result.x[0]\n```\nThis code will return the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. The solution is returned in a numpy array, so we take the first element of the array.",
