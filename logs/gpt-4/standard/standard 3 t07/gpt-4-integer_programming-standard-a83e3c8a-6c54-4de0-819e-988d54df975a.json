    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",
