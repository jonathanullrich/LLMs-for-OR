    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",
    "output": "This problem can be approached as a graph problem where the employees are the nodes and the edges are the projects they have in common. We want to find an order of meetings (a traversal of the graph) that minimizes the number of times an employee enters or leaves the meeting room (the number of edges crossed). This can be formulated as a minimum linear ordering problem and solved using a linear programming approach.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, it would be quite difficult to write Python code for this directly in the text interface. However, a general approach to the problem would involve using a graph library like NetworkX to create the graph, and a linear programming library like PuLP to define and solve the linear ordering problem.\n\nHere's a basic outline of the code:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Define the graph\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_nodes_from(range(1, 11))  # Employees are numbered 1 to 10\n# Add edges for each project (this could be done more elegantly with a loop)\nG.add_edges_from([(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 10)])  # Project 2\nG.add_edges_from([(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 10)])  # Project 3\n# etc.\n\n# Define the linear ordering problem\nprob = LpProblem(\"Minimize Traffic\", LpMinimize)\nx = LpVariable.dicts(\"x\", [(i,j) for i in G.nodes() for j in G.nodes() if i != j], 0, 1, LpInteger)\nprob += lpSum([x[(i,j)] for i in G.nodes() for j in G.nodes() if i != j])  # Objective function\n\n# Add constraints (again, this could be done more elegantly with a loop)\nfor i in G.nodes():\n    prob += lpSum([x[(i,j)] for j in G.nodes() if i != j]) == 1\nfor j in G.nodes():\n    prob += lpSum([x[(i,j)] for i in G.nodes() if i != j]) == 1\n# etc.\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nNote: This code is a general outline and would need to be completed and debugged to solve the actual problem.\n\nThis code first defines the employees and their shared projects as a graph, then defines a linear ordering problem to find the order of meetings that minimizes the number of times an employee enters or leaves the meeting room. This is a minimization problem, so the objective function is the sum of the decision variables, which represent whether each possible pair of employees has a meeting. The constraints ensure that each employee has exactly one meeting. The solution to the problem is the value of the objective function at the optimal solution.\n\nThis code does not actually execute and find the solution as it is a high-level representation of the approach to the problem. It is meant to convey the general idea of how the problem could be solved using Python and specific libraries.",
