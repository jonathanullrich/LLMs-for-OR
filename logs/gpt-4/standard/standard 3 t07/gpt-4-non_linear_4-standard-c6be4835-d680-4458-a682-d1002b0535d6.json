    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.",
    "output": "The total profit, P, is the sum of the profits from Product 1 and Product 2. \n\nGiven that the total number of units produced cannot exceed two per hour (R1 + R2 <= 2), we want to find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize the total profit P.\n\nThis is a problem of optimization under constraints, which can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nHere is Python code that uses Scipy's optimize function to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Objective function (negative profit, as we want to maximize profit)\ndef objective(x):\n    R1, R2 = x\n    return -(200*R1 - 100*R1**2 + 300*R2 - 100*R2**2)\n\n# Constraint (total units produced cannot exceed 2)\nconstraints = ({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda x: 2 - sum(x)})\n\n# Initial guess\nx0 = [1, 1]\n\n# Solve optimization problem\nsolution = minimize(objective, x0, constraints=constraints)\n\n# Output the maximum profit\nsolution = -solution.fun\n```\n\nThis code will find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize the total profit under the constraint that the total number of units produced cannot exceed two per hour. The maximum profit is stored in the variable 'solution'.",
