    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?",
    "output": "This problem can be solved by using linear programming. There are several libraries in Python that can help us solve linear programming problems, such as scipy, numpy, and pulp. Here, we will use the pulp library.\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Create a problem variable\nprob = LpProblem(\"Maximize_Profit\", LpMaximize)\n\n# Create decision variables\nx1 = LpVariable(\"Product_1_units\", 0, None, LpInteger)\nx2 = LpVariable(\"Product_2_units\", 0, 60,   LpInteger) # Limiting the production of product 2 to 60 units.\n\n# Add the objective function\nprob += 1*x1 + 2*x2, \"Total Profit\"\n\n# Add constraints\nprob += 1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200, \"Frame Parts\"\nprob += 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300, \"Electrical Components\"\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained given the constraints. It will determine the number of units of Product 1 and Product 2 to produce in order to achieve this profit.\n\nPlease note that the code should be run in a Python environment where the pulp library is installed. If pulp is not installed, you can install it using pip:\n```python\npip install pulp\n```",
