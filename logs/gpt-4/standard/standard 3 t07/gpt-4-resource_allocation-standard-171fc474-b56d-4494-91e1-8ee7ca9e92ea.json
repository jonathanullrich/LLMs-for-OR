    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "output": "The problem can be solved by a simple dynamic programming approach. \n\nFirst, we can define cost(i, j) as the minimum cost if we have j cars at the beginning of the i-th week.\n\nThe base case is cost(0, j) = 0 for all j.\n\nThe recurrence relation is cost(i, j) = min_{k>=a[i]} {cost(i-1, k-a[i]) + 220*(k-j) + 500 if k>j else cost(i-1, k-a[i]) + 220*(a[i]-j)}.\n\nHere a[i] is the number of cars needed in the i-th week.\n\nThen the minimum cost is min_{0<=j<=20} cost(4, j).\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef min_cost():\n    a = [7, 4, 7, 8]\n    INF = float('inf')\n    dp = [[INF]*21 for _ in range(5)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    for i in range(1, 5):\n        for j in range(a[i-1], 21):\n            for k in range(j, 21):\n                if k > j:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + 220*(k-j) + 500)\n                else:\n                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + 220*(a[i-1]-j))\n    return min(dp[4])\n\nsolution = min_cost()\n```\n\nThis code first initializes a table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost for the i-th week if we have j cars at the beginning of the week. Then for each week, it iterates through all possible numbers of cars we can have at the beginning of the week, and for each number, it iterates through all possible numbers of cars we can rent, and updates the minimum cost accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum cost for the last week.",
