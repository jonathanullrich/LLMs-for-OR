    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",
    "output": "The problem provided is a scheduling problem that can be solved using different algorithms. Here, the simplest approach was taken. The jobs were ordered in ascending order of their due dates, and then the time taken to process each job was summed up. This approach is known as the Earliest Due Date (EDD) rule.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef minimum_processing_time(jobs, due_dates):\n    # sort jobs based on their due dates\n    sorted_jobs = sorted(list(zip(jobs, due_dates)), key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    # calculate total processing time\n    total_time = 0\n    for job in sorted_jobs:\n        total_time += job[0]\n    \n    return total_time\n\njobs = [6, 4, 5, 8]\ndue_dates = [8, 4, 12, 16]\n\nsolution = minimum_processing_time(jobs, due_dates)\n```\n\nPlease note that this solution does not account for the possibility of overlapping job processing times, hence it assumes that a job can only start after the previous one has been completed. If jobs can be processed concurrently, then a more complex scheduling algorithm might be needed.",
