    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The optimum location is sought for an airfield from which the six airfields A to F can be approached. The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.",
    "output": "This is a complex optimization problem which can be solved using optimization libraries in Python such as SciPy. The problem can be formulated as a weighted sum of Euclidean distances, subject to constraints defining the regions that are unsuitable for the airfield. \n\nHere is a Python code to solve the problem using Scipy's minimize function. Note that the problem is a nonlinear optimization problem and can have multiple local minima, therefore, the solution may depend on the starting point of the optimization.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Coordinates and number of flights for each airfield\nairfields = np.array([[40, 200, 40], [160, 210, 10], [250, 160, 20], [220, 80, 30], [100, 40, 20], [30, 100, 10]])\n\n# Objective function: weighted sum of Euclidean distances\ndef objective(x):\n    return np.sum([airfield[2]*np.sqrt((x[0] - airfield[0])**2 + (x[1] - airfield[1])**2) for airfield in airfields])\n\n# Constraints: x + y >= 250 (swamp area), (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 (lake area)\nconstraints = [{'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: x[0] + x[1] - 250},\n               {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 400 - ((x[0] - 100)**2 + (x[1] - 100)**2)}]\n\n# Initial guess\nx0 = np.array([50, 50])\n\n# Minimize the objective function with constraints\nres = minimize(objective, x0, constraints=constraints)\n\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nPlease run the code in your local environment to get the solution.
