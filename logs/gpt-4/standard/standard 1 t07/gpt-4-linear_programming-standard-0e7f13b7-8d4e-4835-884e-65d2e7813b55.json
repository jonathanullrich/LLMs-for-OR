    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?",
    "output": "We can solve this problem using linear programming. For this, we'll use PuLP, a Python library for linear programming.\n\nFirst, we define the problem and the variables:\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\nprob = LpProblem(\"The WorldLight Problem\",LpMaximize)\n\nx1 = LpVariable(\"Product 1 units\",0,None,LpInteger) # Product 1 units\nx2 = LpVariable(\"Product 2 units\",0,60,LpInteger) # Product 2 units\n```\n\nWe then specify the objective function and the constraints:\n\n```python\n# Objective function\nprob += x1 + 2*x2, \"Total Profit\"\n\n# Constraints\nprob += x1 + 3*x2 <= 200, \"Frame Parts\"\nprob += 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300, \"Electrical Components\"\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Print the result\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable will contain the maximum profit that can be achieved given the constraints.",
