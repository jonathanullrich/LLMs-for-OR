The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",

The job with the earliest deadline is processed first. \n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# jobs with processing times and deadlines\njobs = [(6, 8), (4, 4), (5, 12), (8, 16)]\n\n# sort jobs by deadline\nheapq.heapify(jobs)\n\ncurrent_time = 0\nfor job in jobs:\n    processing_time, deadline = job\n    current_time += processing_time\n\nsolution = current_time\n```\n\nThis will provide the minimal time to process all jobs.",
