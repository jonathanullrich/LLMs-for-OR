    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",
    "output": "Here's a Python code that uses linear programming with the help of the PuLP library to solve the problem. \n\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data\nprob = LpProblem(\"Beer Purchasing Problem\", LpMinimize)\n\n# Create problem variables\nx1 = LpVariable(\"x1\", 0, None) # Beer bought from Dick today\nx2 = LpVariable(\"x2\", 0, None) # Beer bought from Harry today\nx3 = LpVariable(\"x3\", 0, None) # Beer bought from Dick tomorrow\nx4 = LpVariable(\"x4\", 0, None) # Beer bought from Harry tomorrow\n\n# The objective function is added to 'prob' first\nprob += 3.00*x1 + 2.90*x2 + 2.70*x3 + 2.80*x4, \"Total Cost of Beers\"\n\n# We can add the constraints to the problem\nprob += x1 + x2 == 3, \"Beer requirement today\"\nprob += x3 + x4 == 4, \"Beer requirement tomorrow\"\nprob += x1 + x3 <= 5, \"Dick's supply limit\"\nprob += x2 + x4 <= 4, \"Harry's supply limit\"\n\n# The problem is solved using PuLP's choice of Solver\nprob.solve()\n\n# The status of the solution is printed on the screen\nprint(\"Status:\", LpStatus[prob.status])\n\n# The optimised objective function value (i.e., the minimum cost) is printed to the console\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\nprint(\"Total Cost of Beers = \", solution)\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' contains the minimum cost Tom would incur to satisfy his beer requirements. The code first defines the problem and the decision variables. Then it sets up the objective function which is to minimize the total cost of beers. The constraints are added next. The problem is solved using the default solver in the library. Finally, the status of the solution and the minimum cost are printed.",
