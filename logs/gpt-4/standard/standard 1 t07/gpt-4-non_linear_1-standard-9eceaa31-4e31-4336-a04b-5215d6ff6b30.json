    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
    "output": "Here is a Python code to solve the problem. The tax revenue is given by the product of the tax rate, the price per cigarette, and the consumption per smoker. We want to find the tax rate that maximizes this revenue. We can use scipy's optimization library to achieve this.\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# base price per cigarette\nbase_price = 0.15\n\n# average daily consumption per smoker as a function of the tax rate\ndef consumption(t):\n    return 53 - 100 * (t / 100)\n\n# tax revenue as a function of the tax rate\ndef revenue(t):\n    return -t * base_price * consumption(t)\n\n# initial guess for the tax rate\ninitial_guess = [0]\n\n# find the tax rate that maximizes the revenue\nresult = minimize(revenue, initial_guess)\n\n# the tax rate that maximizes the revenue\nsolution = result.x[0]\n```\n\nThis code first defines the consumption and revenue functions according to the problem statement. Then it minimizes the negative of the revenue function to find the maximum revenue, starting with an initial guess of 0 for the tax rate. The result is stored in the 'solution' variable.",
