    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "output": "Luxor Travel's demand over the next 4 weeks is [7, 4, 7, 8]. In order to minimize costs, Luxor can handle the demand in the following ways:\n\n1. Rent 7 cars for the first week, then return 3 and rent 4 for the second week, then return all 4 and rent 7 for the third week, and finally rent an additional car for the fourth week. This would include 4 transactions.\n2. Rent 7 cars for the first week, keep all 7 for the second week even though only 4 are needed, then continue to rent 7 for the third week, and rent an additional car for the fourth week. This would include 3 transactions.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for each option to determine the minimal cost.\n\n```python\n# Option 1\ncost_1 = ((7*220) + 500) + ((4*220) + 500) + ((7*220) + 500) + ((8*220) + 500)\n# Option 2\ncost_2 = ((7*220) + 500) + (7*220) + ((7*220) + 500) + ((8*220) + 500)\n\nsolution = min(cost_1, cost_2)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the cost for each option and assigns the minimal cost to the variable 'solution'. The cost for each week is calculated as the rental fee for each car needed that week plus the transaction fee (if applicable). This is based on the assumption that Luxor Travel should rent the minimum number of cars necessary each week to meet demand, and that it is cheaper to keep renting cars than to return them and rent new ones.\n\nPlease note that the code above does not take into account any potential discounts for renting more cars or for longer periods of time, as these were not mentioned in the problem description.",
