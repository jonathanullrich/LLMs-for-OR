    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A Postman has to walk through each street at least once when delivering letters. He must start and end at Point A. He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.",
    "output": "This problem can be solved using the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) algorithm. The CPP is a special case of graph traversal problem where the objective is to find the shortest closed tour (or path) in a graph that visits every edge of the graph at least once.\n\nHere is the Python code using the networkx library to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Defining the graph\nG = nx.MultiGraph()\nedges = [('A', 'B', 2), ('A', 'C', 2), ('B', 'C', 3), ('B', 'D', 4), ('D', 'E', 3),\n         ('D', 'F', 4), ('E', 'F', 9), ('E', 'G', 3), ('F', 'G', 5), ('G', 'H', 3)]\nG.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)\n\n# Finding the vertices with odd degree\nodd_vertices = [v for v, d in G.degree() if d % 2 != 0]\n\n# Adding minimum weight matching edges to the graph\nG.add_edges_from(nx.min_weight_matching(G, maxcardinality=True))\n\n# Finding the eulerian circuit\ncircuit = list(nx.eulerian_circuit(G))\n\n# Calculating the total length of the circuit\nsolution = sum(G[u][v][0]['weight'] for u, v in circuit)\n```\n\nNote: In the code above, we first construct the graph using the given edges and their weights. Then, we find all vertices with odd degree and add the minimum weight matching edges to the graph to make it eulerian (i.e., a graph with a circuit that visits every edge exactly once). Finally, we find the eulerian circuit and calculate the total length of the circuit.",
