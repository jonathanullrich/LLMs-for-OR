    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",
    "output": "To solve this problem, we will use a brute-force approach where we will generate all possible combinations of tasks for Eve and Steven, and then calculate the total time spent for each combination. We will choose the combination with the minimum total time.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the tasks and the time needed for Eve and Steven to perform each task\ntasks = ['Marketing', 'Cooking', 'Dishwashing', 'Laundry']\neve_times = [4.5, 7.8, 3.6, 2.9]\nsteven_times = [4.9, 7.2, 4.3, 3.1]\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of tasks for Eve\neve_combinations = list(itertools.combinations(range(4), 2))\n\nmin_time = float('inf')\nfor comb in eve_combinations:\n    # Calculate the total time for Eve and Steven\n    eve_time = sum(eve_times[i] for i in comb)\n    steven_time = sum(steven_times[i] for i in range(4) if i not in comb)\n    total_time = eve_time + steven_time\n\n    # Update the minimum time if the current total time is less\n    if total_time < min_time:\n        min_time = total_time\n\nsolution = min_time\n```\n\nThis code first generates all possible combinations of tasks for Eve using the `itertools.combinations()` function. It then loops over each combination and calculates the total time for Eve and Steven, updating the minimum time if the current total time is less. The final minimum time is stored in the `solution` variable.",
