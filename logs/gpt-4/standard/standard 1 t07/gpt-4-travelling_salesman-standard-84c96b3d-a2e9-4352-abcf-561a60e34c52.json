    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",
    "output": "This is a combinatorics problem that can be solved using a greedy algorithm in Python. However, the problem is not very well defined and is open to interpretation. If we interpret the problem as minimizing the total number of times an employee enters or exits the room, then one possible approach is to schedule the meetings in order of the number of employees working on each project. \n\nThis Python code uses the collections library to count the number of employees working on each project, then sorts the projects by this count in descending order. The code then iterates through the sorted projects, adding the number of employees working on each project to the total.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# List of employees working on each project\nproject_employees = {\n    1: {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10},\n    2: {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10},\n    3: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8},\n    4: {1, 3, 4, 8, 10},\n    5: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10},\n    6: {3, 6, 7, 9, 10}\n}\n\n# Count the number of employees working on each project\nemployee_counts = Counter()\nfor employees in project_employees.values():\n    employee_counts.update(employees)\n\n# Sort the projects by the number of employees in descending order\nsorted_projects = sorted(project_employees, key=lambda p: -len(project_employees[p]))\n\n# Calculate the total number of entries/exits\ntotal_entries_exits = 0\nfor project in sorted_projects:\n    total_entries_exits += len(project_employees[project])\n\nsolution = total_entries_exits\n```\n\nThis code assumes that each employee enters and exits the room once for each meeting, and that no employees stay in the room between meetings. If employees are allowed to stay in the room between meetings, then the problem becomes more complex and would likely require a more advanced algorithm.",
