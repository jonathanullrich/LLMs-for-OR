    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.",
    "output": "This problem can be solved using calculus. The total profit is the sum of the profits from the two products. So, the problem is to maximize the total profit subject to the constraint that the total production rate cannot exceed two units per hour. \n\nWe can define the total profit as a function of the production rates R1 and R2 and then take the derivative of this function with respect to R1 and R2 to find the maximum. \n\nIn python, we can implement this as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, diff, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nR1, R2 = symbols('R1 R2')\n\n# Define the profit functions\nprofit_1 = 200*R1 - 100*R1**2\nprofit_2 = 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\n\n# Define the total profit function\ntotal_profit = profit_1 + profit_2\n\n# Take the derivative of the total profit function with respect to R1 and R2\nderivative_R1 = diff(total_profit, R1)\nderivative_R2 = diff(total_profit, R2)\n\n# Set the derivatives equal to zero and solve for R1 and R2\nsolution_R1 = solve(derivative_R1, R1)\nsolution_R2 = solve(derivative_R2, R2)\n\n# Because of the constraint that the total production rate cannot exceed two units per hour, we take the minimum of the solutions\nsolution_R1 = min(solution_R1)\nsolution_R2 = min(solution_R2)\n\n# Calculate the maximum total profit\nsolution = total_profit.subs({R1: solution_R1, R2: solution_R2})\n\nsolution\n```\n\nPlease note that this code returns the maximum total profit and the production rates that achieve this maximum profit. If the constraint that the total production rate cannot exceed two units per hour is not met, then the solution may not be valid. In this case, the constraint would need to be incorporated into the optimization problem, which would likely require a different approach.",
