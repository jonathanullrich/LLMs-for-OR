    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",
    "output": "The given problem can be solved by using the shortest processing time first (SPT) rule. The SPT rule states that the job with the shortest processing time should be scheduled first. \n\nHowever, this rule does not consider the deadlines of the jobs. In this case, we need to consider both the processing times and the deadlines of the jobs.\n\nWe can solve this problem by sorting the jobs in the order of their deadlines and processing the jobs in this order. If two jobs have the same deadline, the job with the shortest processing time should be processed first.\n\nHere is a Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\njobs = [(1, 6, 8), (2, 4, 4), (3, 5, 12), (4, 8, 16)]\njobs.sort(key = lambda x: (x[2], x[1]))\n\ntime = 0\nfor job in jobs:\n    time += job[1]\n\nsolution = time\n```\n\nIn this code, `jobs` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a job. The first element of the tuple is the job number, the second element is the processing time of the job, and the third element is the deadline of the job.\n\nThe `sort` function is used to sort the jobs in the order of their deadlines. If two jobs have the same deadline, the job with the shortest processing time is placed before the other job.\n\nThe `for` loop is used to calculate the total processing time of the jobs. In each iteration, the processing time of the current job is added to `time`.\n\nFinally, `time` is assigned to `solution`. So, `solution` is the minimal time to process the jobs.",
