    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",
    "output": "This problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem with the following constraints and objectives:\n\n- Tom's thirst requirements: He needs 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow. This translates to two constraints:\n    - pints_from_Dick_today + pints_from_Harry_today = 3\n    - pints_from_Dick_tomorrow + pints_from_Harry_tomorrow = 4\n\n- Dick and Harry's maximum quantity: Dick can sell a maximum of 5 pints and Harry can sell a maximum of 4 pints. This translates to two more constraints:\n    - pints_from_Dick_today + pints_from_Dick_tomorrow <= 5\n    - pints_from_Harry_today + pints_from_Harry_tomorrow <= 4\n\n- The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the cost of the pints bought from Dick and Harry today and tomorrow. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the PuLP library in Python, which allows us to easily define and solve linear programming problems.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data\nprob = LpProblem(\"Minimum Cost Problem\",LpMinimize)\n\n# Create decision variables\npints_from_Dick_today = LpVariable(\"Pints from Dick today\",0)\npints_from_Dick_tomorrow = LpVariable(\"Pints from Dick tomorrow\",0)\npints_from_Harry_today = LpVariable(\"Pints from Harry today\",0)\npints_from_Harry_tomorrow = LpVariable(\"Pints from Harry tomorrow\",0)\n\n# The objective function is added to 'prob' first\nprob += 3*pints_from_Dick_today + 2.7*pints_from_Dick_tomorrow + 2.9*pints_from_Harry_today + 2.8*pints_from_Harry_tomorrow, \"Total cost\"\n\n# We can add the constraints to the problem\nprob += pints_from_Dick_today + pints_from_Harry_today == 3, \"Today's requirement\"\nprob += pints_from_Dick_tomorrow + pints_from_Harry_tomorrow == 4, \"Tomorrow's requirement\"\nprob += pints_from_Dick_today + pints_from_Dick_tomorrow <= 5, \"Dick's limit\"\nprob += pints_from_Harry_today + pints_from_Harry_tomorrow <= 4, \"Harry's limit\"\n\n# The problem data is written to an .lp file\nprob.writeLP(\"MinimumCostProblem.lp\")\n\n# The problem is solved using PuLP's choice of Solver\nprob.solve()\n\n# The status of the solution is printed to the screen\nprint(\"Status:\", LpStatus[prob.status])\n\n# Each of the variables is printed with its resolved optimum value\nfor v in prob.variables():\n    print(v.name, \"=\", v.varValue)\n\n# The optimized objective function value is printed to the screen\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\nprint(\"Total cost of the beer = \", solution)\n```\n\nPlease note that you need to install the PuLP library before running this code. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pulp\n```",
