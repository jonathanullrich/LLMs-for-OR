    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",
    "output": "The problem can be solved using the concept of portfolio optimization which involves finding an optimal combination of investments to achieve a desired return with the least amount of risk.\n\nThe problem can be formulated as a quadratic programming problem with the objective function being the variance of the portfolio and the constraints being the budget constraint and the desired return constraint.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the cvxpy library in python which is used for solving optimization problems.\n\nHere is the python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n# Define the variables\nx1 = cp.Variable()  # Investment in stock 1\nx2 = cp.Variable()  # Investment in stock 2\n\n# Define the parameters\nprice1 = 20\nprice2 = 30\nreturn1 = 5\nreturn2 = 10\nvariance1 = 4\nvariance2 = 100\ncovariance = 5\nbudget = 50  # Total budget in 1000s\ndesired_return = 15  # Desired return in %\n\n# Define the objective function\nrisk = variance1*x1**2 + variance2*x2**2 + 2*covariance*x1*x2\nobjective = cp.Minimize(risk)\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [x1 + x2 <= budget,  # Budget constraint\n               return1*x1 + return2*x2 >= desired_return*budget]  # Desired return constraint\n\n# Define and solve the problem\nprob = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\nprob.solve()\n\n# Convert the solution from 1000s to dollars\nsolution = (x1.value + x2.value) * 1000\n```\n\nPlease note that the solution obtained here is the optimal investment strategy in terms of the number of 1000s to be invested in each stock. The variable 'solution' contains the total amount of investment in dollars, which is the minimum amount required to achieve a return of 15 percent.\n\nPlease install the necessary libraries and run the code in a python environment to get the solution. Also, note that this code assumes that short selling is not allowed, i.e., the investments cannot be negative.",
