    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
    "output": "Sure, I can do that. First, let's formulate the problem:\n\nTax revenue is given by the product of the tax rate, the price per cigarette, and the demand (average daily consumption). So, we need to maximize the function R(t) = t * 0.15 * (53 - t).\n\nWe can solve this maximization problem using calculus. Specifically, we take the derivative of the function, set it equal to zero, and solve for t. Here is a Python implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, diff, solve\n\nt = symbols('t')\nR = t * 0.15 * (53 - t)\nR_prime = diff(R, t)\nt_optimal = solve(R_prime, t)[0]\nsolution = t_optimal\n```\n\nThis will give the optimal tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. However, since we're dealing with a real world scenario, we need to consider that tax rate can't be negative. Therefore, if the solution gives a negative tax rate, the optimal tax rate should be 0. Here is the modified Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, diff, solve\n\nt = symbols('t')\nR = t * 0.15 * (53 - t)\nR_prime = diff(R, t)\nt_optimal = solve(R_prime, t)[0]\n\nif t_optimal < 0:\n    solution = 0\nelse:\n    solution = t_optimal\n```\n\nThis will give the optimal tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue considering the constraint that tax rate can't be negative.",
