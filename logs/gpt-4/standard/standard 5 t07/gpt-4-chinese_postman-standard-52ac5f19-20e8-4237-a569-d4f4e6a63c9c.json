    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A Postman has to walk through each street at least once when delivering letters. He must start and end at Point A. He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.",
    "output": "This problem is a variant of the Chinese Postman Problem. We can use the NetworkX package in Python to solve it. \n\nFirst, we create a graph using NetworkX and add the given edges along with their weights. Then, we find the odd degree nodes and calculate all pair shortest paths for these nodes. We will find the minimum weight perfect matching in the subgraph induced by odd degree nodes. Finally, we will find an Eulerian circuit in the modified graph which gives us the optimal route.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\n\n# Create a graph\nG = nx.MultiGraph()\n\n# Add edges to the graph\nedges = [('A', 'B', 2), ('A', 'C', 2), ('B', 'C', 3), ('B', 'D', 4), ('D', 'E', 3),\n         ('D', 'F', 4), ('E', 'F', 9), ('E', 'G', 3), ('F', 'G', 5), ('G', 'H', 3)]\n\nG.add_weighted_edges_from(edges)\n\n# Find nodes of odd degree\nodd_degree_nodes = [node for node, degree in G.degree() if degree % 2 == 1]\n\n# Calculate all pair shortest paths\nodd_node_pairs = list(itertools.combinations(odd_degree_nodes, 2))\nodd_node_pair_paths = {pair: nx.shortest_path(G, pair[0], pair[1]) for pair in odd_node_pairs}\n\n# Compute the weights of these paths\nodd_node_pair_shortest_paths = {pair: sum(G.edges[path[i-1], path[i]]['weight'] for i in range(1, len(path)))\n                                for pair, path in odd_node_pair_paths.items()}\n\n# Find the minimum weight perfect matching in the subgraph induced by odd_degree_nodes\nmin_weight_matching = nx.max_weight_matching(G.subgraph(odd_degree_nodes), maxcardinality=True)\n\n# Add the edges of the minimum weight perfect matching to the original graph\nG.add_edges_from(min_weight_matching)\n\n# Find an Eulerian circuit in the modified graph\neuler_circuit = list(nx.eulerian_circuit(G, source='A'))\n\n# Compute the total weight of the Eulerian circuit\nsolution = sum(G.edges[edge[0], edge[1]]['weight'] for edge in euler_circuit)\n```\n\nIn the above code, 'solution' will hold the minimal length to walk through all the streets. This code will work assuming that the graph is connected and has at least two nodes. If not, additional code to handle these cases may be needed.",
