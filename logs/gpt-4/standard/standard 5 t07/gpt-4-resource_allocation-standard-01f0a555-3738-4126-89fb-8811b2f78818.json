    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "output": "Here is a simple Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the demand for each week\ndemand = np.array([7, 4, 7, 8])\n\n# Define the cost per car per week\nrental_cost = 220\n\n# Define the flat fee for any rental transaction\ntransaction_fee = 500\n\n# Initialize an array to store the minimal cost for each week\nminimal_cost = np.zeros(demand.shape[0])\n\n# Calculate the minimal cost for each week\nfor i in range(demand.shape[0]):\n    if i == 0:\n        # Rent the cars for the first week\n        minimal_cost[i] = demand[i] * rental_cost + transaction_fee\n    else:\n        # Check if it's cheaper to keep the cars from last week or rent new ones\n        keep_cost = demand[i] * rental_cost + (demand[i-1] - demand[i]) * rental_cost\n        rent_new_cost = demand[i] * rental_cost + transaction_fee\n        minimal_cost[i] = min(keep_cost, rent_new_cost)\n\n# The minimal cost is the sum of the minimal cost for each week\nsolution = minimal_cost.sum()\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the cost for the first week. Then, for each subsequent week, it checks if it's cheaper to keep the cars from the last week or rent new ones, and choose the cheaper option. The minimal cost is the sum of the minimal cost for each week.",
