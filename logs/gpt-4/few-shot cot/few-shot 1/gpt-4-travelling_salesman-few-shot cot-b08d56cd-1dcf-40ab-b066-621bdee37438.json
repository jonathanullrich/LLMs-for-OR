If an employee works on two projects, an edge is created between these two projects. The weight of each edge represents the number of employees working on both projects connected by the edge. The goal is to find the order of meetings (order of visiting nodes) that minimizes the traffic (sum of weights) in and out of the meeting room. This problem can be formulated as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n\nHowever, the TSP requires to visit each node exactly once and return to the starting node, which is not required in this problem. Hence, we can solve this problem as a Shortest Path Problem (SPP) instead. We can convert the graph into a directed graph where each edge is replaced by two directed edges in opposite directions. The weight of each directed edge is the number of employees leaving the meeting room if the meeting for the project represented by the destination node is scheduled after the meeting for the project represented by the source node. Then, we can find the shortest path from each node to all other nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm and choose the shortest path among them as the order of meetings.\n\nHere is the Python code for the above approach:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Define the projects each employee works on\nemployee_projects = {\n    1: [2, 4, 5],\n    2: [1, 3, 5],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    4: [3, 4, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3],\n    6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    7: [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    8: [1, 3, 4],\n    9: [5, 6],\n    10: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n\n# Create a graph with projects as nodes and employees as edges\nG = nx.Graph()\nfor employee, projects in employee_projects.items():\n    for i in range(len(projects)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(projects)):\n            if G.has_edge(projects[i], projects[j]):\n                G[projects[i]][projects[j]]['weight'] += 1\n            else:\n                G.add_edge(projects[i], projects[j], weight=1)\n\n# Convert the graph into a directed graph\nDG = G.to_directed()\n\n# Calculate the shortest path from each node to all other nodes\npaths = nx.shortest_path(DG, weight='weight')\n\n# Find the shortest path among all paths\nmin_path = None\nmin_weight = float('inf')\nfor source, targets in paths.items():\n    for target, path in targets.items():\n        weight = sum(DG[path[i]][path[i+1]]['weight'] for i in range(len(path)-1))\n        if weight < min_weight:\n            min_path = path\n            min_weight = weight\n\nsolution = min_weight\n```\n\nIn this code, we first define the projects each employee works on.
