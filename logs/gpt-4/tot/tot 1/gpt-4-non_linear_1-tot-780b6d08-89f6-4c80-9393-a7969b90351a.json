Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "output": ["Choice 0: The tax revenue is the product of the number of cigarettes consumed, the base price per cigarette, and the tax rate. This can be expressed as a function R(t) = f(t)*base price*t = (53 - 100*(t/100))*0.15*t. \n\nTo find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we'll need to find the maximum of this function. We can do this by taking the derivative of the function, setting it equal to zero, and solving for t. The values of t that solve this equation are critical points of the function.\n\nWe then evaluate the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of its domain (the possible tax rates, which must be between 0 and 100), and the maximum of these values is the maximum tax revenue.\nChoice 1: Sure. The best approach to solve this problem is through calculus and optimization principles. \n\nThe tax revenue R is given by the average daily consumption per smoker times the tax rate times the base price of a cigarette, or R = f * t * p, where p is the price per cigarette. \n\nFirst, we substitute the given function f = 53 - 100*(t/100) into the revenue formula. \n\nThen, we take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to t to find the tax rate that maximizes revenue. \n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero gives us the critical points. \n\nWe then determine which of these points is a maximum by evaluating the second derivative at these points. \n\nIf the second derivative is negative, then the tax rate t is a maximum. \n\nFinally, we plug this value of t back into the revenue equation to get the maximum revenue.\nChoice 2: To solve this problem, we could use the concept of revenue maximization. The total revenue from the tax is given by the product of the tax rate, the base price per cigarette, and the average daily consumption per smoker. So, we first need to define a function for the tax revenue. Then, to find the tax rate that maximizes the revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to the tax rate and set it equal to zero. This will give us the tax rate at which revenue is maximized.", "Analyzing each choice:\n\nChoice 0: This choice correctly identifies the need to find the maximum of the revenue function by taking its derivative and setting it equal to zero.
