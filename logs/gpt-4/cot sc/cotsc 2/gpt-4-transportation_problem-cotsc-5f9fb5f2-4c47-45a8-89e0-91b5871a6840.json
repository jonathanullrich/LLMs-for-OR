Let's denote the number of pints he buys from Dick on day 1 as x1, from Dick on day 2 as x2, from Harry on day 1 as y1, and from Harry on day 2 as y2.\n\nThen, we need to define the constraints:\n\n1. Total number of pints bought from Dick (x1 + x2) must be less than or equal to 5 (Max. limit set by Dick)\n2. Total number of pints bought from Harry (y1 + y2) must be less than or equal to 4 (Max. limit set by Harry)\n3. Total number of pints bought on day 1 (x1 + y1) must be equal to 3 (Tom's requirement for day 1)\n4. Total number of pints bought on day 2 (x2 + y2) must be equal to 4 (Tom's requirement for day 2)\n\nThe objective is to minimize the cost, which is 3.00x1 + 2.70x2 + 2.90y1 + 2.80y2.\n\nWe can use a linear programming package such as scipy to solve this problem. Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients in the objective function\nc = [3.00, 2.70, 2.90, 2.80]\n\n# Coefficients in the inequality constraints\nA = [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1]]\n\n# RHS values for inequality constraints\nb = [5, 4]\n\n# Coefficients in the equality constraints\nA_eq = [[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]\n\n# RHS values for equality constraints\nb_eq = [3, 4]\n\n# Solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=b_eq, bounds=(0, None))\n\n# Print the result\nsolution = res.x\n\nprint('Tom should buy from Dick on day 1: ', solution[0], 'pints')\nprint('Tom should buy from Dick on day 2: ', solution[1], 'pints')\nprint('Tom should buy from Harry on day 1: ', solution[2], 'pints')\nprint('Tom should buy from Harry on day 2: ', solution[3], 'pints')\n```\n\nThis code will find the optimal solution for the given problem.", "Sure, let's break it down:\n\n1. Tom needs 3 pints today. He can buy all 3 from Harry at $2.90 each, or he can buy 2 from Dick at $3.00 each and 1 from Harry, or he can buy all 3 from Dick, but that would be costliest. So, the first option is the best for today.\n\n2. Tom needs 4 pints tomorrow. He can buy all 4 from Dick at $2.70 each or he can buy 3 from Dick and 1 from Harry, or he can buy 2 from Dick and 2 from Harry. In this case, the last option is the best.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost for each day:\n\n1. Today: 3 pints * $2.90 = $8.70\n2. Tomorrow: 2 pints * $2.70 (from Dick) + 2 pints * $2.80 (from Harry) = $5.40 + $5.60 = $11.00\n\nLet's add these up:\n\n$8.70 (today) + $11.00 (tomorrow) = $19.70\n\nSo, the minimum cost Tom can get to satisfy his thirst requirements is $19.70. \n\nHere's the corresponding Python code:\n\n```\n# Costs\ncost_today_harry = 2.90\ncost_today_dick = 3.00\ncost_tomorrow_harry = 2.80\ncost_tomorrow_dick = 2.70\n\n# Number of pints\npints_today = 3\npints_tomorrow = 4\n\n# Calculate costs\ncost_today = pints_today * cost_today_harry\ncost_tomorrow = (pints_tomorrow / 2) * cost_tomorrow_harry + (pints_tomorrow / 2) * cost_tomorrow_dick\n\n# Calculate total cost\nsolution = cost_today + cost_tomorrow\n\nprint(\"The minimum cost Tom can get to satisfy his thirst requirements is ${}\".format(solution))\n```\n", "Firstly, Tom needs to figure out from whom to buy the beer each day to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements.\n\nOn the first day, Tom needs 3 pints. Given the prices, it's cheaper to buy from Harry at $2.90 per pint. However, Harry has a maximum limit of 4 pints. Therefore, Tom can buy all 3 pints from Harry on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, Tom needs 4 pints. Harry can only sell 1 more pint, so Tom will have to buy the remaining 3 pints from Dick at $2.70 per pint.\n\nNow, let's write a python code to calculate the total cost:\n\n```\n# Prices\nprice_harry_today = 2.90\nprice_harry_tomorrow = 2.80\nprice_dick_today = 3.00\nprice_dick_tomorrow = 2.70\n\n# Quantities\nquantity_harry_today = 3\nquantity_harry_tomorrow = 1\nquantity_dick_today = 0\nquantity_dick_tomorrow = 3\n\n# Calculate costs\ncost_harry_today = price_harry_today * quantity_harry_today\ncost_harry_tomorrow = price_harry_tomorrow * quantity_harry_tomorrow\ncost_dick_today = price_dick_today * quantity_dick_today\ncost_dick_tomorrow = price_dick_tomorrow * quantity_dick_tomorrow\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = cost_harry_today + cost_harry_tomorrow + cost_dick_today + cost_dick_tomorrow\n\nsolution = total_cost\n```\nThis code will calculate the total cost for Tom's beer purchases from Harry and Dick over the two days.

Harry sells at a cheaper price ($2.90) compared to Dick ($3.00), so Tom should buy from Harry. However, Harry can only sell a maximum of 4 pints total, so Tom should buy 3 pints from Harry today and the rest from Dick.\n\nSecondly, for the 4 pints needed tomorrow, Tom should buy from Dick because he sells at a cheaper price ($2.70) compared to Harry ($2.80). However, since he already bought 3 pints from Dick today, he can only buy 2 pints from Dick tomorrow. So, he should buy the remaining 2 pints from Harry tomorrow.\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Objective function coefficients\nc = [3.00, 2.70, 2.90, 2.80]  \n\n# Inequality constraints matrix\nA = [[1, 0, 1, 0],  \n     [0, 1, 0, 1],\n     [1, 1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 1, 1]]\n\n# Inequality constraints vector\nb = [3, 4, 5, 4]\n\n# Bounds of variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, None)\nx2_bounds = (0, None)\nx3_bounds = (0, None)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds, x2_bounds, x3_bounds])\n\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' represents the minimum cost Tom needs to spend to satisfy his thirst.
