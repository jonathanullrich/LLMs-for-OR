Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": ["This problem can be solved using integer linear programming. \n\nLet's denote:\n- x1 as the number of units of product 1 to produce\n- x2 as the number of units of product 2 to produce\n\nThe objective function we want to maximize is the profit, which is $1*x1 + $2*x2.\n\nThe constraints are:\n- For frame parts: x1 + 3*x2 <= 200\n- For electrical components: 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300\n- For the limit of product 2: x2 <= 60\n\nSince we can't produce a negative number of units, x1 and x2 must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem and can be solved using the scipy library in python. Let's write a python code to solve this problem. \n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients in the objective function\nc = [-1, -2]\n\n# Coefficients in the inequality constraints\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]\n\n# Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\nb = [200, 300]\n\n# Bounds for variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = -res.fun\n```\n\nHere, we used the linprog function from scipy to solve the problem. The 'c' argument to the function is the coefficients of the objective function. The 'A_ub' and 'b_ub' arguments are the coefficients and the right-hand side of the inequality constraints, respectively. The 'bounds' argument is the lower and upper bounds for each variable. The 'method' argument is the linear programming method to use. 'Highs' is the default method in the latest versions of scipy.\n\nPlease note that the linprog function minimizes the objective function by default. Since we are looking to maximize the profit, we passed the negative of the coefficients of the objective function to the function. The function returned the minimum of the negated function, which is the negative of the maximum. That's why we negated the function value in the result to get the maximum profit. \n\nThe variable 'solution' will hold the maximum profit that the company can achieve.", "We can solve this problem using linear programming techniques. \n\nThe decision variables are:\n- x1 (number of units of product 1)\n- x2 (number of units of product 2)\n\nThe objective function to maximize is:\n- profit = 1*x1 + 2*x2 \n\nWe have the following constraints:\n- Frame parts: 1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200\n- Electrical components: 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300\n- Maximum units of product 2: x2 <= 60\n\nNow, we can write this as a linear programming problem in Python using the scipy library. \n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of objective function\nc = [-1, -2]\n\n# Inequality constraints matrix\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]\n\n# Inequality constraints vector\nb = [200, 300]\n\n# Bounds of the variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Compute the maximum profit\nsolution = -res.fun\n```\n\nYou can run this code and the variable 'solution' will contain the maximum profit.\nNote that we're using negative coefficients in the objective function because linprog solves minimization problems. To solve a maximization problem, we can convert it into a minimization problem by multiplying the objective function by -1.", "First, we need to define our decision variables. Let's denote the number of units of product 1 produced as x1 and the number of units of product 2 produced as x2. \n\nNext, let's construct our objective function. Our objective is to maximize our profit, which is given by the equation $P = 1*x1 + 2*x2.\n\nFinally, we need to consider our constraints. The number of units of frame parts and electrical components that can be used are limited to 200 and 300 respectively. This gives us two constraints: \n\n1 unit of frame parts * x1 + 3 units of frame parts * x2 <= 200\n2 units of electrical components * x1 + 2 units of electrical components * x2 <= 300\n\nBesides, we also know that we can't produce more than 60 units of product 2 that yield a profit, which gives us another constraint: x2 <= 60.\n\nWe can now solve this problem using linear programming. Python has a library called SciPy that has a function for linear programming problems. Here is how we can set up and solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of objective function\nc = [-1, -2]  # We are maximizing, linprog is for minimization problems so we take negative\n\n# Coefficients of inequality constraints, Ax <= b\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]\nb = [200, 300]\n\n# Bounds for variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Print optimal values of x1 and x2\nprint('Optimal values:', res.x)\n\n# Calculate total profit\nsolution = -res.fun\nprint('Total profit:', solution)\n```\n\nThis code will give us the optimal number of units of product 1 and 2 to produce in order to maximize profit, as well as the value of the maximum profit.", "First, we have two variables: the amount of product 1 and product 2 to produce. Let's denote them by x1 and x2.\n\nSecond, we have restrictions on the resources: 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. This gives us the following inequalities:\n\nx1 + 3x2 <= 200 (restriction on frame parts)\n2x1 + 2x2 <= 300 (restriction on electrical components)\n\nThird, we have a restriction on the amount of product 2 to produce: x2 <= 60.\n\nFinally, we want to maximize the profit, which is given by x1 + 2x2. \n\nLet's solve this problem using python's package pulp for linear programming.", "First, we need to identify the decision variables in this problem. The decision variables are the quantities of each product to produce, let's denote them by x1 and x2.\n\nSecond, we need to establish the objective function. In this case, the objective is to maximize profit, which is $1 per unit of product 1 and $2 per unit of product 2, for the first 60 units. Therefore, the objective function is: \n\nMaximize P = 1*x1 + 2*x2\n\nFinally, we need to determine the constraints on the variables. The constraints are the availability of frame parts and electrical components. For every unit of product 1, one unit of frame parts and two units of electrical components are required, and for every unit of product 2, three units of frame parts and two units of electrical components are required. Therefore, the constraints are:\n\nx1 + 3*x2 \u2264 200 (frame parts)\n2*x1 + 2*x2 \u2264 300 (electrical components)\nx2 \u2264 60 (profit limit)\n\nLet's solve this problem using pulp library in python, which is a library for linear programming."], "code": ["from scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients in the objective function\nc = [-1, -2]\n\n# Coefficients in the inequality constraints\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]\n\n# Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\nb = [200, 300]\n\n# Bounds for variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = -res.fun", "from scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of objective function\nc = [-1, -2]\n\n# Inequality constraints matrix\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]\n\n# Inequality constraints vector\nb = [200, 300]\n\n# Bounds of the variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Compute the maximum profit\nsolution = -res.fun", "from scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of objective function\nc = [-1, -2]  # We are maximizing, linprog is for minimization problems so we take negative\n\n# Coefficients of inequality constraints, Ax <= b\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]\nb = [200, 300]\n\n# Bounds for variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Print optimal values of x1 and x2\nprint('Optimal values:', res.x)\n\n# Calculate total profit\nsolution = -res.fun\nprint('Total profit:', solution)", "", ""], "solutions": [175.0, 175.0, 175.0], "result": 175.0}
