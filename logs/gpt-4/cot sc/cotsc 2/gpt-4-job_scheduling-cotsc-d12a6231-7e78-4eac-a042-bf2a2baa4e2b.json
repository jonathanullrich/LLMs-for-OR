The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16.

This approach is known as the Earliest Due Date (EDD) rule.\n\nFirst, let's arrange the jobs in the order of their due dates:\n\n- Job 2 (due day 4, processing time 4 days)\n- Job 1 (due day 8, processing time 6 days)\n- Job 3 (due day 12, processing time 5 days)\n- Job 4 (due day 16, processing time 8 days)\n\nLet's calculate the time to process the jobs:\n\n- Start Job 2 at day 0, finish at day 4.\n- Start Job 1 at day 4, finish at day 10 (2 days late).\n- Start Job 3 at day 10, finish at day 15.\n- Start Job 4 at day 15, finish at day 23.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time to process all jobs is 23 days.", "First, we need to process the jobs according to their deadlines. The job with the earliest deadline should be processed first. \n\nHowever, we also need to consider the processing time. If a job with an early deadline has a long processing time, it may prevent us from completing other jobs on time. \n\nTherefore, we can use a greedy algorithm where we sort the jobs according to the ratio of their processing time to their deadline. The job with the smallest ratio should be processed first.\n\nLet's write the Python code for this problem. \n\n```python\n# Define the jobs with their processing times and deadlines\njobs = [(6, 8), (4, 4), (5, 12), (8, 16)]\n\n# Calculate the ratio of processing time to deadline for each job\nratios = [p/d for p, d in jobs]\n\n# Sort the jobs in increasing order of the ratio\nsorted_jobs = [job for _, job in sorted(zip(ratios, jobs))]\n\n# Process the jobs in the sorted order and calculate the total processing time\ntotal_time = 0\nfor p, _ in sorted_jobs:\n    total_time += p\n\n# Print the total processing time\nsolution = total_time\n```\nWith this code, the `solution` variable will contain the minimum total processing time.", "Firstly, we need to prioritize the jobs based on their due dates because we want to minimize the time to process all jobs and avoid any penalties for late completion.\n\nFrom the given data, we know that Job 2 has the tightest deadline. However, it will take 4 days to complete, and thus, it should be done first.\n\nNext, we can look at the remaining jobs. Job 1 is due on Day 8, but it will take 6 days to complete. Thus, we should start it after Job 2.\n\nAfter completing Job 1 and Job 2, we would be on Day 10. The next job due is Job 3, which needs to be completed by Day 12 and will take 5 days. This can't be done within the deadline, so we should start it immediately after Job 1.\n\nFinally, Job 4 needs to be completed by Day 16 and will take 8 days, so we can start it after Job 3.\n\nSo, the sequence of jobs is: Job 2 -> Job 1 -> Job 3 -> Job 4.\n\nLet's calculate the total time:\n\n- Job 2: 4 days\n- Job 1: 4 days + 6 days = 10 days\n- Job 3: 10 days + 5 days = 15 days\n- Job 4: 15 days + 8 days = 23 days\n\nSo, the minimal time to process all the jobs is 23 days.", "We have four jobs with varying processing times and deadlines.\n\nJob 1: 6 days to complete with a deadline on day 8.\nJob 2: 4 days to complete with a deadline on day 4.\nJob 3: 5 days to complete with a deadline on day 12.\nJob 4: 8 days to complete with a deadline on day 16.\n\nWe can see that the jobs must be completed by their respective deadlines and they can be processed one after the other as there is only one machine.\n\nIf we proceed in the order of the jobs given, we would finish Job 1 on day 6, Job 2 on day 10, which is beyond the deadline for Job 2.
