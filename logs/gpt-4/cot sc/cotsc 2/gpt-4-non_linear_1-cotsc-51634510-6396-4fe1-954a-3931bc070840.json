Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": ["Firstly, we know that the average daily consumption per smoker is given by the function f = 53 - 100*(t/100), where t is the tax rate.\n\nNext, we know that the total tax revenue is given by the product of the tax rate, the base price per cigarette, and the average daily consumption per smoker.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the tax rate t that maximizes the tax revenue, which is equivalent to maximizing the function f(t) = t * 0.15 * (53 - t).\n\nThis is a quadratic function, which reaches its maximum at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b/2a.\n\nIn this case, a = -0.15, b = 0.15*53, and c = 0.\n\nTherefore, the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is t = -b/2a = -(0.15*53)/(-0.15*2).\n\nLet's calculate this.", "Tax revenue can be calculated as the product of the tax rate, the base price per cigarette, and the average daily consumption per smoker. \n\nSo, Revenue (R) = Tax rate (t) * Base price per cigarette (p) * Average daily consumption per smoker (f)\n\nReplace f with the given function, we get:\n\nR = t * p * (53 - 100*(t/100))\n\nThen, we need to maximize this function. Since this is a quadratic function, its maximum can be found by finding the derivative and setting it to zero.\n\nLet's write the python code to solve this.", "Firstly, we have to understand that the tax revenue is simply the tax rate times the consumption. In this case, we have the consumption as a function of the tax rate. So, we can write the revenue R as follows:\n\nR(t) = t * f(t) = t * (53-100*(t/100)).\n\nThis is a quadratic function, and its maximum will occur at its vertex. For a quadratic function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is -b/(2a). In our case, a = -100/100 = -1, and b = 53. Therefore, the tax rate that maximizes the revenue is t = -b/(2a) = -53/(-2) = 26.5. However, we need to check if this value of t gives a valid consumption f(t), since it can't be negative. Let's do this calculation.\n\nf(t) = 53 - 100*(t/100) = 53 - 26.5 = 26.5.\n\nSince the consumption is not negative, t = 26.5 is indeed the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "Firstly, we need to establish a function for the total tax revenue generated. The total tax revenue is the product of the number of cigarettes consumed and the tax per cigarette.\n\nGiven the tax per cigarette is t/100, and the consumption per smoker is f, the tax revenue per smoker is f*(t/100). \n\nThen, we need to find the tax rate t that maximizes this revenue. We can do this by taking the derivative of the revenue function with respect to t, setting it equal to zero, and then solving for t.\n\nThe derivative of f*(t/100) with respect to t is (53 - 100*(t/100))*(1/100) - 100*(t/100)^2/100.\n\nSetting this equal to zero gives us t = 53/2 = 26.5%.\n\nTherefore, the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is 26.5%. \n\nHowever, this result is a little counter-intuitive, as it suggests that higher tax rates would lead to lower tax revenue. This is because the relationship between cigarette consumption and tax rate is assumed to be linear, which may not be the case in reality. A more accurate model might take into account the fact that at higher tax rates, some smokers may quit entirely, leading to a drop in tax revenue.", "First, we need to set up the function to represent tax revenue. \n\nThe tax revenue (R) from each cigarette is given by the tax rate (t) times the base price (0.15). The total tax revenue then is the product of revenue per cigarette, the average consumption per smoker (f), and the number of smokers. \n\nLet's assume, for simplicity, that the number of smokers is constant and equal to 1. This doesn't affect the problem because we're interested in the tax rate that maximizes revenue, which doesn't depend on the number of smokers. \n\nSo, we have:\n\nR = t * 0.15 * f \nR = t * 0.15 * (53 - 100*(t/100)) \n\nThis is the function we need to maximize. It's a quadratic function which reaches its maximum value at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b/2a. Here, a = -1.5, and b = 7.95, so the value of t that maximizes R is -b/2a = -7.95 / (2 * -1.5). \n\nWe can write the python code now. \n\n```python\n# coefficients of the quadratic function\na = -1.5\nb = 7.95\n\n# calculate the tax rate that maximizes revenue\nsolution = -b / (2 * a)\n```\n\nThis will give us the tax rate that maximizes tax revenue."], "code": ["", "", "", "", "# coefficients of the quadratic function\na = -1.5\nb = 7.95\n\n# calculate the tax rate that maximizes revenue\nsolution = -b / (2 * a)"], "solutions": [2.65], "result": 2.65}
