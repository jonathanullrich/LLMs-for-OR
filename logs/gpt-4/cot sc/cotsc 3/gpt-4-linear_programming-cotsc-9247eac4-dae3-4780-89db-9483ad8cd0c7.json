Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": ["Sure, let's break it down:\n\n1. We need to decide how many units of each product to make. Let's denote the number of units of product 1 by x1 and the number of units of product 2 by x2. \n\n2. The profit is $1 per unit of product 1 and $2 per unit of product 2. So our total profit will be P = x1 + 2*x2. We want to maximize this.\n\n3. We have constraints on the number of units of frame parts and electrical components that we can use. For frame parts, we have 1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200. For electrical components, we have 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300.\n\n4. We also have a constraint that we cannot make more than 60 units of product 2: x2 <= 60.\n\n5. Finally, we cannot make a negative number of units, so x1, x2 >= 0.\n\nWe can use linear programming to solve this problem. Here is a Python code using the Scipy library:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of objective function\nc = [-1, -2] # we want to maximize P = x1 + 2*x2\n\n# Inequality constraints matrix\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]\n\n# Inequality constraints vector\nb = [200, 300]\n\n# Bounds of x\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = -res.fun # because linprog minimizes the objective function, we take the negative of the result to get the maximum\n```\n\nThis code will give us the number of units of each product to produce (res.x) and the maximum profit (solution).", "First, let's denote the number of units of product 1 as x and the number of units of product 2 as y.\n\nThe problem gives us the following constraints:\n\n1. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. This can be written as: x + 3y <= 200 (This is the frame parts constraint)\n\n2. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. This can be written as: 2x + 2y <= 300 (This is the electrical components constraint)\n\n3. The company can produce at most 60 units of product 2 for profit: y <= 60\n\n4. The number of units produced cannot be negative, so: x >= 0, y >= 0\n\nWe want to maximize the profit, which is $1 for each unit of product 1 and $2 for each unit of product 2. So, our objective function is:\n\nMaximize P = x + 2y\n\nThis is a linear programming problem. There are several Python libraries that can solve such problems, one of which is scipy.optimize.linprog. Let's solve this problem using this library.\n\nThe linprog function minimizes the objective function, so we need to change our problem to a minimization problem by multiplying the objective function by -1:\n\nMinimize P' = -x - 2y\n\nNow we can write the Python code.", "Sure, here is the step by step guide:\n\n1. Understand the problem: We need to maximize profit by deciding the number of units of two products to produce. There are limited resources (frame parts and electrical components) and the profit from each product varies.\n\n2. Define the decision variables: Let's denote x1 as the number of units of product 1 to produce and x2 as the number of units of product 2 to produce. \n\n3. Formulate the objective function: The total profit is $1 * x1 + $2 * x2. We want to maximize this function.\n\n4. Formulate the constraints: \n\n   a. The number of frame parts used can't exceed the available frame parts: 1 * x1 + 3 * x2 <= 200.\n   \n   b. The number of electrical components used can't exceed the available electrical components: 2 * x1 + 2 * x2 <= 300.\n   \n   c. We can't produce more than 60 units of product 2 for profit: x2 <= 60.\n   \n   d. We can't produce negative units of any product: x1 >= 0, x2 >= 0.\n\n5. Solve the problem: Use a linear programming solver, such as the one provided by the scipy library, to find the optimal solution.\n\n6. Report the result: The optimal solution is the one that maximizes the profit while satisfying all the constraints.", "First, we need to set up our decision variables. In this case, they are the number of units of product 1 and product 2 to produce. We'll represent these as x1 and x2, respectively.\n\nNext, we need to define our objective function, which is the total profit. This is given by $1 * x1 + $2 * x2, and we want to maximize this.\n\nFinally, we need to set up our constraints:\n\n1. The number of frame parts used cannot exceed the number available. This gives us the constraint: x1 + 3*x2 <= 200.\n\n2. Similarly, the number of electrical components used cannot exceed the number available. This gives us the constraint: 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300.\n\n3. The number of units of product 2 cannot exceed 60. This gives us the constraint: x2 <= 60.\n\n4. The number of units of each product produced must be non-negative. This gives us the constraints: x1 >= 0 and x2 >= 0.\n\nNow we can use a linear programming solver to solve this problem. Python's scipy library has a function for this, called linprog. We'll use it to find the optimal values of x1 and x2. Let's implement this in the cell below.", "First, we need to define the problem as a linear program. We'll use x1 to denote the number of units of product 1 and x2 to denote the number of units of product 2. \n\nOur objective function is the profit, which can be written as: \n\nProfit = $1*x1 + $2*x2\n\nWe also have several constraints. The amount of metal frame parts used cannot exceed the available amount, so: \n\nx1 + 3*x2 <= 200\n\nSimilarly, the amount of electrical parts used cannot exceed the available amount, so: \n\n2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300\n\nFinally, we cannot produce more than 60 units of product 2, so: \n\nx2 <= 60\n\nWe also have a non-negativity constraint, x1, x2 >= 0. \n\nNow we can solve this linear programming problem using a linear programming solver.
