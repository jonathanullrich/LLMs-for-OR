Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": ["Sure, let's break this problem down.\n\nFirstly, we need to understand that this is a combinatorial optimization problem. For these kinds of problems, we can use integer programming. Integer programming is a type of linear programming where the solutions are restricted to integer values.\n\nSecondly, the data needs to be organized in a way we can work with. We have five swimmers and four strokes. Each swimmer has a time for each stroke (some are faster than others). We need to assign one swimmer to each stroke such that the total time is minimized.\n\nNext, we need to set up our integer programming problem. We need to define our decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\n- Decision Variables: We can define a binary decision variable for each swimmer and each stroke. If swimmer i is assigned to stroke j, then the decision variable will be 1, otherwise 0.\n\n- Objective Function: Our goal is to minimize the total time. Therefore, our objective function will be the sum of the time swimmer i takes to swim stroke j multiplied by the corresponding decision variable.\n\n- Constraints: We have two types of constraints. Firstly, each swimmer can only be assigned to one stroke. Secondly, each stroke can only be assigned to one swimmer.\n\nFinally, we can solve our integer programming problem using a solver. The solution will give us the assignment of swimmers to strokes that minimizes the total time.\n\nNow, we can translate this into Python code. We can use the pulp library in Python to solve integer programming problems.", "Firstly, we should recognize that this problem is a type of assignment problem where we are trying to assign tasks (the strokes) to resources (the swimmers) in a way that minimizes the total time. We can use the Hungarian Algorithm to solve this problem.\n\nLet's start by creating a cost matrix where each row represents a swimmer and each column represents a stroke. Each element in the matrix represents the time it takes for a swimmer to complete a stroke. The goal is to find the assignment that minimizes the total time. \n\nWe can use the Munkres package in python, also known as the Hungarian algorithm, to solve this problem. \n\nHere is the python code:\n\n```python\nfrom munkres import Munkres, print_matrix\n\nmatrix = [[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # times for Carl\n          [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # times for Chris\n          [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # times for David\n          [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # times for Tony\n          [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]  # times for Ken\n\nm = Munkres()\n\nindexes = m.compute(matrix)\nprint_matrix(matrix, msg='Lowest cost through this matrix:')\ntotal = 0\nfor row, column in indexes:\n    value = matrix[row][column]\n    total += value\n    print(f'({row}, {column}) -> {value}')\nprint(f'total cost: {total}')\n\nsolution = total\n```\n\nThis code calculates the optimal assignment and the corresponding total time. It also prints the assignment and the total time. The final total time is assigned to the variable 'solution'.", "First, we need to create a 2-dimensional array (5x4) where the rows represent the swimmers and the columns represent the different strokes. The value at each cell in the array will be the best time achieved by the swimmer for that stroke.\n\nThen, we'll use an algorithm to find the best assignment of swimmers to strokes that minimizes the total time. This is a classic example of an assignment problem, which can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm.\n\nHere is the Python code using the scipy library's implementation of the Hungarian algorithm:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# Define the cost matrix\ncost = np.array([\n    [37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n    [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n    [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n    [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n    [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]   # Ken\n])\n\n# Apply the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment\nrow_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)\n\n# Calculate the minimum time\nsolution = cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()\n```\n\nThe 'solution' variable now holds the minimum sum of the best times achieved by the optimal assignment of swimmers to strokes.", "First, we need to model this problem as a linear programming problem. We can do that by defining a decision variable for each possible assignment of a swimmer to a stroke. For example, we could have a variable x[Carl, Backstroke] that equals 1 if Carl is assigned to Backstroke, and 0 otherwise. We would have similar variables for each swimmer and each stroke.\n\nThe objective function we want to minimize is the total time spent by the swimmers. This can be modeled as the sum of the best time of the swimmer assigned to a stroke multiplied by the corresponding decision variable.\n\nFinally, our constraints are that each swimmer can only be assigned to one stroke, and each stroke must be assigned to one swimmer.\n\nWe can use a linear programming solver to solve this problem. For this, we can use Python's PuLP library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for defining and solving linear programming problems.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data\nprob = LpProblem(\"Swim Team Assignment\", LpMinimize)\n\n# The decision variables are actually created here\nchoices = LpVariable.dicts(\"Choice\", ((s, t) for s in swimmers for t in strokes), cat='Binary')\n\n# The objective function is added to 'prob' first\nprob += lpSum([choices[s, t] * times[s][t] for s in swimmers for t in strokes])\n\n# We can add the constraints to the problem\nfor s in swimmers:\n    prob += lpSum([choices[s, t] for t in strokes]) == 1\n\nfor t in strokes:\n    prob += lpSum([choices[s, t] for s in swimmers]) == 1\n\n# The problem is solved using PuLP's choice of Solver\nprob.solve()\n\n# Get the total time\ntotal_time = sum(choices[s, t].varValue * times[s][t] for s in swimmers for t in strokes)\n\nsolution = total_time\n```\n\nNote that the `swimmers`, `strokes`, and `times` variables are not defined in this code snippet. You would need to define them based on the data you have. Here is how you could do it:\n\n```python\nswimmers = [\"Carl\", \"Chris\", \"David\", \"Tony\", \"Ken\"]\nstrokes = [\"Backstroke\", \"Breaststroke\", \"Butterfly\", \"Freestyle\"]\ntimes = {\n    \"Carl\": {\"Backstroke\": 37.7, \"Breaststroke\": 43.4, \"Butterfly\": 33.3, \"Freestyle\": 29.2},\n    \"Chris\": {\"Backstroke\": 32.9, \"Breaststroke\": 33.1, \"Butterfly\": 28.5, \"Freestyle\": 26.4},\n    \"David\": {\"Backstroke\": 33.8, \"Breaststroke\": 42.2, \"Butterfly\": 38.9, \"Freestyle\": 29.6},\n    \"Tony\": {\"Backstroke\": 37.0, \"Breaststroke\": 34.7, \"Butterfly\": 30.4, \"Freestyle\": 28.5},\n    \"Ken\": {\"Backstroke\": 35.4, \"Breaststroke\": 41.8, \"Butterfly\": 33.6, \"Freestyle\": 31.1}\n}\n```\n\nThis should give you the minimum total time and the corresponding assignment of swimmers to strokes.", "The first step is to model this problem. We can think of each swimmer as a node in a network, and each stroke as a type of job that needs to be done. Our task is to assign each job to a node such that the total cost (time spent) is minimized. This is the well-known assignment problem in operations research, and it can be solved efficiently using the Hungarian algorithm.\n\nThe Hungarian algorithm works on a cost matrix. In our case, the cost matrix would be a 5x4 matrix, where each row corresponds to a swimmer and each column corresponds to a stroke. The entry in the i-th row and j-th column would be the time taken by the i-th swimmer to complete the j-th stroke.\n\nLet's create our cost matrix first. We'll represent our data as a dictionary for easy access, and then convert it to a matrix. \n\nNext, we'll use the `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` function to solve the assignment problem, which implements the Hungarian algorithm. \n\nFinally, we'll sum up the times of the optimal assignments to get our answer."], "code": ["", "from munkres import Munkres, print_matrix\n\nmatrix = [[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # times for Carl\n          [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # times for Chris\n          [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # times for David\n          [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # times for Tony\n          [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]  # times for Ken\n\nm = Munkres()\n\nindexes = m.compute(matrix)\nprint_matrix(matrix, msg='Lowest cost through this matrix:')\ntotal = 0\nfor row, column in indexes:\n    value = matrix[row][column]\n    total += value\n    print(f'({row}, {column}) -> {value}')\nprint(f'total cost: {total}')\n\nsolution = total", "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# Define the cost matrix\ncost = np.array([\n    [37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n    [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n    [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n    [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n    [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]   # Ken\n])\n\n# Apply the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment\nrow_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)\n\n# Calculate the minimum time\nsolution = cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()", "from pulp import *\n\n# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data\nprob = LpProblem(\"Swim Team Assignment\", LpMinimize)\n\n# The decision variables are actually created here\nchoices = LpVariable.dicts(\"Choice\", ((s, t) for s in swimmers for t in strokes), cat='Binary')\n\n# The objective function is added to 'prob' first\nprob += lpSum([choices[s, t] * times[s][t] for s in swimmers for t in strokes])\n\n# We can add the constraints to the problem\nfor s in swimmers:\n    prob += lpSum([choices[s, t] for t in strokes]) == 1\n\nfor t in strokes:\n    prob += lpSum([choices[s, t] for s in swimmers]) == 1\n\n# The problem is solved using PuLP's choice of Solver\nprob.solve()\n\n# Get the total time\ntotal_time = sum(choices[s, t].varValue * times[s][t] for s in swimmers for t in strokes)\n\nsolution = total_time\nswimmers = [\"Carl\", \"Chris\", \"David\", \"Tony\", \"Ken\"]\nstrokes = [\"Backstroke\", \"Breaststroke\", \"Butterfly\", \"Freestyle\"]\ntimes = {\n    \"Carl\": {\"Backstroke\": 37.7, \"Breaststroke\": 43.4, \"Butterfly\": 33.3, \"Freestyle\": 29.2},\n    \"Chris\": {\"Backstroke\": 32.9, \"Breaststroke\": 33.1, \"Butterfly\": 28.5, \"Freestyle\": 26.4},\n    \"David\": {\"Backstroke\": 33.8, \"Breaststroke\": 42.2, \"Butterfly\": 38.9, \"Freestyle\": 29.6},\n    \"Tony\": {\"Backstroke\": 37.0, \"Breaststroke\": 34.7, \"Butterfly\": 30.4, \"Freestyle\": 28.5},\n    \"Ken\": {\"Backstroke\": 35.4, \"Breaststroke\": 41.8, \"Butterfly\": 33.6, \"Freestyle\": 31.1}\n}", ""], "solutions": [126.2, 126.2], "result": 126.2}
