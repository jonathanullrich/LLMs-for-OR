He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3).

        "Sure, here is a step by step process to find the minimal route.\n\n1. Identify all streets that must be walked through: AB, AC, BC, BD, DE, DF, EF, EG, FG, GH. There are 10 streets in total.\n\n2. Identify which points have odd number of streets going out of them. In this case, these are points B, D, E, F, G, H. \n\n3. We would need to make sure that these points are visited an even number of times, so they would be the starting and ending points of a walk, or they would have to be passed through twice.\n\n4. Calculate the path with the shortest distance. \n\n5. The shortest path would be: A-B-C-A-D-E-G-H-G-F-D-B-A. This path goes through all the streets at least once and starts and ends at point A.\n\n6. The total distance of this path would be: 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 35.\n\nSo, the minimal length of the route that the postman has to walk through is 35.",
        "First, let's visualize the given problem. Here's how we can map the Postman's route:\n\n```\nA - B - D - E - G - H\n|  /    |    \\   /\n| /     |     \\ /\nC       F ----- E\n```\n\nThe distance between each point is marked on the lines. Now, let's try to find the minimal path.\n\nThe shortest path for this problem can be found by using the concept of Eulerian Path and Eulerian Circuit which states that a necessary condition for the existence of Eulerian Circuit is that all vertices belong to the same connected component and that every vertex has even degree. \n\nAs the problem states that the Postman has to start and end at Point A and walk through each street at least once, it means we are looking for an Eulerian Circuit.\n\nLooking at our graph, we see that points B, D, E, F, and G have odd degrees. To make these points have even degree, we'll have to duplicate the shortest edges connected to them.\n\nHere's the additional path we'll have to take: B-C-B (2+3=5), D-F-D (4+4=8), E-F-E (9+9=18), and F-G-F (5+5=10)\n\nNow, let's finally calculate the total minimal distance the Postman has to walk.\n\nThe original total distance of all edges is: 2+2+3+4+3+4+9+3+5+3 = 38\n\nAdding the additional path to these: 38 + 5 + 8 + 18 + 10 = 79\n\nSo, the Postman has to walk a minimal distance of 79 to deliver all letters and return to the starting point A.",
        "Sure, this problem can be solved by using graph theory. We need to find a route that visits each edge (street) at least once. This is known as an Eulerian circuit or path. \n\nSince the Postman must start and end at Point A, we are looking for an Eulerian circuit. \n\nAn Eulerian circuit exists in a graph if all vertices have even degree (the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it). \n\nLooking at the degrees of each vertex: \n- A has degree 2 (connected to B and C)\n- B has degree 3 (connected to A, C and D)\n- C has degree 2 (connected to A and B)\n- D has degree 3 (connected to B, E and F)\n- E has degree 3 (connected to D, F and G)\n- F has degree 3 (connected to D, E and G)\n- G has degree 3 (connected to E, F and H)\n- H has degree 1 (connected to G)\n\nFrom this, we can see that there are vertices with an odd degree (B, D, E, F, G, H), hence an Eulerian circuit does not exist.\n\nHowever, we can make an Eulerian circuit possible by duplicating the smallest edges incident to vertices with odd degree.\n\nB-D (length 4) is duplicated.\nD-E (length 3) is duplicated.\nE-F (length 9) is duplicated.\nF-G (length 5) is duplicated.\nG-H (length 3) is duplicated.\n\nThe total length of the duplicated edges is 24.\n\nThe total length of all the original edges is 38.\n\nTherefore, the minimal length of the route to walk through all the streets is 38 + 24 = 62.",
        "The first thing the postman needs to do is to identify all the streets he needs to cover, or in mathematical terms, all the edges in the graph. We look at the problem as a graph where the points are the nodes and the streets are the edges. The length of each street is the weight of the edge. In such a case, we are looking for the minimal length that connects all the edges, also known as the minimum spanning tree.\n\nHowever, this problem has an additional constraint. He must start and end at Point A. This makes it a problem of finding the minimum length tour that starts and ends at a specific node and visits all edges at least once. This problem is a variant of the Chinese Postman Problem.\n\nThe Chinese Postman Problem is a problem in graph theory where the task is to find the shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of a (connected) undirected graph. When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a circuit that uses every edge once), this path is an Eulerian circuit. \n\nWe can solve this problem by using the following steps:\n\n   1. Find all the nodes of the graph that have an odd degree (a node has an odd degree if an odd number of edges are incident to it).\n   2. Pair up the odd degree nodes and find the pairings that have the minimum total distance.\n   3. Duplicate the edges that are in the minimum total distance pairings.\n   4. Find an Eulerian circuit of the graph.\n   \nI will proceed by first representing the graph and then implementing these steps.",
        "Okay, let's take a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Identify all the streets that the postman has to walk through. These are: A-B, A-C, B-C, B-D, D-E, D-F, E-F, E-G, F-G, and G-H.\n\n2. Determine the length of each street. These are: A-B (2), A-C (2), B-C (3), B-D (4), D-E (3), D-F (4), E-F (9), E-G (3), F-G (5), and G-H (3).\n\n3. Since the postman has to start and end at Point A, we need to find a route that will allow him to walk through each street at least once, while minimizing the total length walked. \n\n4. We will use the Chinese Postman Problem algorithm to find the shortest route. This algorithm is based on the concept of graph theory and Eulerian circuits.\n\n5. It's important to note that the postman can walk through a street multiple times, and in both directions.\n\n6. The Chinese Postman Problem can be solved using a variety of algorithms, including Dijkstra's Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, and Bellman-Ford Algorithm.\n\n7. The problem can be solved using Python and the networkx library, which allows for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.\n\n8. This problem can also be solved using a brute force approach, where all possible routes are generated and the shortest one is selected. However, this approach is not efficient and can take a very long time if there are many streets.\n\n9. A better approach would be to use a heuristic algorithm, which provides an approximate solution for the problem. Heuristic algorithms are often faster and more efficient than brute force approaches, but they do not always guarantee the optimal solution.\n\n10. Unfortunately, I am an AI model trained to assist with information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge. I am not currently capable of writing python code, but I can guide you on how you could approach writing the code. \n\nHere's a rough outline of what your python code could look like:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries (like networkx, numpy, etc.)\n2. Define the points and the distances between them\n3. Create a graph with the points as nodes and the distances as edges\n4. Use the appropriate algorithm or function to find the shortest path\n5. Print the shortest path and its length.\n\nRemember to test your code and debug any errors that might come up."
