    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",

        "The tax revenue generated from cigarette consumption can be calculated as the product of the average daily consumption per smoker, the base price per cigarette, and the tax rate. This can be represented as:\n\nR = f*p*t = (53 - 100*(t/100)) * 0.15 * t\n\nThis is a quadratic function of t, which means that it will have a maximum value. To find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we need to find the value of t that corresponds to the maximum of this function.\n\nThe maximum or minimum of a quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c occurs at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -100*0.15, b = 53*0.15, and c = 0. So the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is t = -b/(2a). \n\nLet's calculate this.",
        "First, we need to determine the function of tax revenue. Since the tax revenue is the product of the price per cigarette, the tax rate, and the average daily consumption, we have the function R(t) = 0.15*t*(53 - 100*t/100), where R(t) is the tax revenue, and t is the tax rate.\n\nThen, to maximize the tax revenue, we need to find the maximum of the function R(t). Since the function is a quadratic function, it has a maximum at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of the function f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c is given by -b/(2*a). In our case, the coefficient a is -0.15, and the coefficient b is 0.15*53, so we have:\n\nt_max = -0.15*53 / (2 * -0.15) = 53 / 2 = 26.5\n\nTherefore, the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is 26.5%.",
        "Sure, let's break it down.\n\n1. We know that the revenue generated from the tax is equal to the tax rate times the number of cigarettes consumed.\n2. The number of cigarettes consumed is given by the function 53 - 100*(t/100).\n3. Thus, the revenue R can be represented as R = t*(53 - 100*(t/100)).\n4. We want to find the tax rate t that maximizes R.\n5. To find the maximum of a function, we can take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero, then solve for t.\n6. The derivative of R with respect to t is dR/dt = 53 - 200*(t/100).\n7. Setting dR/dt equal to zero gives us 0 = 53 - 200*(t/100), which we can solve for t. \n\nLet's now write the Python code to solve for t.",
        "First, we know that the tax revenue is the product of the number of cigarettes consumed and the tax per cigarette. The tax per cigarette is the tax rate t times the base price per cigarette, which is 15 cents. \n\nThe tax revenue R can be expressed as follows:\n\nR = f * t * 0.15\n\nSubstituting the function for f, we get:\n\nR = (53 - 100*(t/100)) * t * 0.15\n\nThis is the function we want to maximize. \n\nWe can solve this problem using calculus. The maximum of a function occurs where its derivative is zero. However, since we are dealing with a tax rate, we have a constraint: the tax rate t must be between 0 and 100. \n\nTherefore, we will first find the derivative of R, set it equal to zero and solve for t. If the solution is between 0 and 100, it is the tax rate that maximizes the revenue. If the solution is not between 0 and 100, the maximum revenue is reached at either t = 0 or t = 100. \n\nLet's do these calculations.",
        "Sure, \n\nThe tax revenue can be calculated as the product of the average daily consumption per smoker, the tax rate, and the base price per cigarette. \n\nThe tax revenue function R(t) can be written as R(t) = f(t) * t * 0.15, where f(t) is the average daily consumption per smoker, t is the tax rate, and 0.15 is the base price per cigarette. \n\nSubstitute the given function f(t) = 53 - 100*(t/100) into R(t), you get R(t) = (53 - 100*(t/100)) * t * 0.15. \n\nYou want to maximize this function. \n\nTo find the maximum point of a function, you can take the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero, then solve for t. \n\nThe derivative of R(t) is R'(t) = 0.15 * (53 - 2*t). \n\nSet R'(t) = 0 and solve for t, you get t = 26.5. \n\nSo, the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is 26.5%. \n\nLet me implement this in python."
