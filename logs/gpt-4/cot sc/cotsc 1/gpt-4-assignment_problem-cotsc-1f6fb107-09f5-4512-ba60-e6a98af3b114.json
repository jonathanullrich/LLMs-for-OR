    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.",

        "First, we need to create a cost matrix that represents the time each swimmer takes for each stroke. \n\nThen, we will use the linear sum assignment function from the scipy library, which applies the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment.\n\nThis function will return two arrays: one for the row indices and one for the chosen column indices. The minimum time is the sum of the cost matrix elements at these indices.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# Define the cost matrix\ncost = np.array([[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n                 [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n                 [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n                 [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n                 [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]) # Ken\n\n# Use the linear_sum_assignment function to find the optimal assignment\nrow_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)\n\n# Calculate the minimum time\nsolution = cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()\n\n```\n\nSo, 'solution' will be the minimum time spend.",
        "First, we need to create a list of all possible combinations of 4 swimmers from the given 5. Then, for each combination, we need to find all possible assignments of the 4 strokes to the 4 swimmers. For each assignment, we calculate the total time and keep track of the minimum. Finally, the minimum total time is the solution. \n\nWe can use the itertools.combinations and itertools.permutations functions from the itertools module in Python to generate the combinations and permutations. Let's write the code.",
        "First, we need to define the problem as an optimization problem. We have 5 swimmers and 4 strokes. We can assign each swimmer to only one stroke, and each stroke needs to be assigned to one swimmer. The total time is the sum of the times of the swimmers in their assigned strokes. We want to minimize this total time. \n\nNext, we can model this problem as a linear programming problem. Let's define binary decision variables x[i,j] which equals 1 if swimmer i is assigned to stroke j and 0 otherwise. We can define our objective function as the sum of the times of the swimmers in their assigned strokes, which is the sum of x[i,j]*time[i,j] for all i and j. \n\nWe have two sets of constraints. First, each swimmer can be assigned to only one stroke, so the sum of x[i,j] over all j for each i must be equal to 1. Second, each stroke needs to be assigned to one swimmer, so the sum of x[i,j] over all i for each j must be equal to 1.\n\nWe can use the pulp library in python to solve this linear programming problem. Let's implement this.",
        "Firstly, we need to formulate this problem as a linear programming problem. We can create decision variables x[i,j] for each swimmer i and each stroke j. If swimmer i is assigned to stroke j, x[i,j] equals 1, otherwise it equals 0. \n\nOur objective is to minimize the total time, which is sum(x[i,j]*time[i,j] for all i and j).\n\nWe have the constraints:\n\n1. Each stroke must be assigned to exactly one swimmer. This can be formulated as sum(x[i,j] for all i) equals 1 for each j.\n\n2. Each swimmer can be assigned to at most one stroke. This can be formulated as sum(x[i,j] for all j) <= 1 for each i.\n\nWith these definitions, we can write the python code to solve this problem. We can use the pulp library in python to solve linear programming problems.",
        "The problem is a classic example of the assignment problem which can be solved using the Hungarian Algorithm. We'll create a cost matrix using the given data where each row represents a swimmer and each column represents a stroke. The goal is to find the minimum total cost such that each swimmer is assigned to exactly one stroke and each stroke is done by exactly one swimmer.\n\nLet's write the python code to solve the problem using the scipy library's linear_sum_assignment function which implements the Hungarian Algorithm. We'll also use numpy to create and manipulate the cost matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# Define the cost matrix\ncost = np.array([\n    [37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n    [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n    [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n    [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n    [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]   # Ken\n])\n\n# Use the Hungarian Algorithm to find the optimal assignment\nrow_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)\n\n# Calculate the minimum total time\nsolution = cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()\n```\nNow, 'solution' has the minimum total time a medley relay team can achieve."
