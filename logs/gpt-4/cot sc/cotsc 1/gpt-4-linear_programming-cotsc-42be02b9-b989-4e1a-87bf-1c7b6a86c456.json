    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?",

        "Firstly, we need to identify our decision variables. In this case, they are the number of units of product 1 (let's call it x) and product 2 (let's call it y) to be produced.\n\nSecondly, we need to form our objective function. Here, the aim is to maximize profit, which is $1 per unit of product 1 and $2 per unit of product 2 (up to 60 units). So, the objective function becomes: Maximize P=1*x + 2*y\n\nThirdly, we need to identify the constraints. We have two resources: frame parts and electrical components. For frame parts, the constraint is: x + 3*y \u2264 200. For electrical components, the constraint is: 2*x + 2*y \u2264 300. Also, as mentioned, we can't produce more than 60 units of product 2 for profit, so y \u2264 60.\n\nNow let's solve this problem using Python's PuLP library which is used for linear programming problems.",
        "1. First, we recognize that this is a linear programming problem. We have a set of linear constraints (the number of metal frame parts and electrical components available) and a linear objective function (the total profit, which is a sum of the profits from each product).\n\n2. We can represent the number of units of product 1 produced as x and the number of units of product 2 produced as y.\n\n3. The constraints on the problem can then be written as:\n   - x + 3y \u2264 200 (we can't use more frame parts than we have)\n   - 2x + 2y \u2264 300 (we can't use more electrical components than we have)\n   - y \u2264 60 (we can't produce more than 60 units of product 2)\n\n4. The objective function is the profit, which is $1 for every unit of product 1 and $2 for every unit of product 2. This can be written as: Profit = x + 2y.\n\n5. As this is a maximization problem, we need to find the values of x and y that maximize the objective function, subject to the constraints.\n\nWe can solve this problem by using a linear programming solver. A commonly used linear programming solver is the scipy.optimize.linprog function in Python's scipy library. This function minimizes a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. Since our problem is a maximization problem, we can convert it to a minimization problem by multiplying the objective function by -1. Then, the linprog function can be used to find the solution.\n\nHere is a Python code that uses the linprog function to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of the objective function\nc = [-1, -2] \n\n# Coefficients of the inequality constraints\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]] \n\n# Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\nb = [200, 300] \n\n# Bounds for the variables\nx_bounds = (0, None)\ny_bounds = (0, 60)\n\n# Solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds])\n\n# Calculate the total profit\nsolution = -res.fun\n\nprint('The maximum total profit is:', solution)\n```\n\nPlease note that in the code above, the objective function is multiplied by -1 (hence the coefficients -1 and -2) to convert the maximization problem to a minimization problem. The solution is then multiplied by -1 to get the maximum profit.",
        "First, let's denote the number of units of product 1 to produce as x, and the number of units of product 2 to produce as y.\n\nThe objective function to maximize is:\n`Profit = 1x + 2y`\n\nGiven the constraints, we have:\n1. For frame parts: `x + 3y <= 200`\n2. For electrical components: `2x + 2y <= 300`\n3. We can't produce negative units : `x,y >= 0`\n4. We cannot produce more than 60 units of product 2 for profit: `y <= 60`\n\nNow, we can use a method called Linear Programming to solve this problem. This method is used in operations research to find the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.\n\nHere is how we can form the python code.\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\nc = [-1, -2]    # Coefficients for the objective function. (We want to maximize our profit)\n\nA = [[1, 3], [2, 2]]   # Coefficients for the inequalities\nb = [200, 300]   # Right-hand side of the inequalities\n\nx0_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds of x\nx1_bounds = (0, 60)    # Bounds of y\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = res.fun*-1  # We multiply by -1 because linprog performs minimization\n```\n\nIn the above python code, we used the `linprog` method from the `scipy.optimize` module, which implements linear programming.\n\nThe `linprog` function minimizes a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. Since we require maximization of our objective function, we need to convert it into a minimization problem by taking the negation of the objective function.\n\nThe variable 'solution' will hold the maximum profit that can be obtained.",
        "First, we can establish that the production of the two products is subject to the following constraints:\n\n1. The number of frame parts used cannot exceed the available supply of 200 units.\n2. The number of electrical components used cannot exceed the available supply of 300 units.\n3. The number of units of product 2 produced cannot exceed 60 units.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can set up a linear programming problem to solve for the maximum profit. Linear programming is a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.\n\nIn this case, the profit from each unit of product 1 is $1 and from each unit of product 2 is $2. Hence, our objective function (the function that we want to maximize) is: \n\nP = 1*X1 + 2*X2\n\nwhere X1 is the number of units of product 1 and X2 is the number of units of product 2.\n\nThe constraints can be represented as follows:\n\n1. X1 + 3*X2 <= 200  (frame parts constraint)\n2. 2*X1 + 2*X2 <= 300  (electrical components constraint)\n3. X2 <= 60  (maximum units of product 2 constraint)\n\nLet's use the Python library Scipy to solve this linear programming problem. The linprog function can be used to minimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. Note that we'll need to turn our maximization problem into a minimization problem by negating the objective function:\n\nP = -1*X1 - 2*X2\n\nNow, let's start coding.",
        "Firstly, we can model this as a linear programming problem. We have two variables, x1 (units of product 1) and x2 (units of product 2).\n\nOur objective function is to maximize profit, which is given by $1*x1 + $2*x2.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n1. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. Hence, x1 <= 200 (the number of available frame parts) and 2*x1 <= 300 (the number of available electrical components).\n2. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. Hence, 3*x2 <= 200 and 2*x2 <= 300.\n3. The company doesn't want to produce more than 60 units of product 2. Hence, x2 <= 60.\n\nNow, we'll use pulp library in python to solve this problem."
