    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",

        "Sure, it's important to first understand the problem before starting to code. \n\nThe problem is basically an assignment problem where we need to assign tasks to two people in a way that the total time spent on all tasks is minimum. \n\nIn this case, the tasks are Marketing, Cooking, Dishwashing, and Laundry. And the two people are Eve and Steven. \n\nWe have the time each person would take to complete each task. We need to choose two tasks for each person such that the total time is minimum.\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to compare the time it takes for each person to do each task, and assign the task to the person who can do it in the least amount of time. \n\nLet's start writing the code.",
        "First, we should determine who is more efficient in which tasks. \n\n- For Marketing, Eve is more efficient (4.5 < 4.9).\n- For Cooking, Steven is more efficient (7.2 < 7.8).\n- For Dishwashing, Eve is more efficient (3.6 < 4.3).\n- For Laundry, Eve is more efficient (2.9 < 3.1).\n\nHowever, since each person must have two tasks, we can't simply assign the tasks to the person who is more efficient for each one. We need to find the combination of tasks that will minimize the total time spent.\n\nLet's consider the combinations:\n\n1. If Eve takes Marketing and Dishwashing, she will spend 4.5 + 3.6 = 8.1 hours. Then Steven has to take Cooking and Laundry, spending 7.2 + 3.1 = 10.3 hours. The total time will be 8.1 + 10.3 = 18.4 hours.\n\n2. If Eve takes Marketing and Laundry, she will spend 4.5 + 2.9 = 7.4 hours. Then Steven has to take Cooking and Dishwashing, spending 7.2 + 4.3 = 11.5 hours. The total time will be 7.4 + 11.5 = 18.9 hours.\n\n3. If Eve takes Dishwashing and Laundry, she will spend 3.6 + 2.9 = 6.5 hours. Then Steven has to take Marketing and Cooking, spending 4.9 + 7.2 = 12.1 hours. The total time will be 6.5 + 12.1 = 18.6 hours.\n\nFrom these, the combination that minimizes the total time spent is the first one, where Eve takes Marketing and Dishwashing, and Steven takes Cooking and Laundry. The total time spent will be 18.4 hours. So, the minimum time spent to do the chores is 18.4 hours. \n\nTherefore, the value of the variable 'solution' is 18.4.",
        "First, assign each task to the person who can complete it in the shortest time. \n\nEve should do Marketing (4.5 hours < 4.9 hours) and Dishwashing (3.6 hours < 4.3 hours). \n\nSteven should do Cooking (7.2 hours < 7.8 hours) and Laundry (3.1 hours < 2.9 hours). \n\nBut, as per the problem, each person has to do two tasks. So, let's see if swapping any task between them will reduce the total time. \n\nIf we swap Marketing (Eve to Steven) and Cooking (Steven to Eve), the total time will be (7.8 + 3.6) for Eve and (4.9 + 3.1) for Steven. \n\nIf we swap Marketing (Eve to Steven) and Laundry (Steven to Eve), the total time will be (4.5 + 2.9) for Eve and (4.9 + 7.2) for Steven. \n\nIf we swap Dishwashing (Eve to Steven) and Cooking (Steven to Eve), the total time will be (7.8 + 2.9) for Eve and (4.9 + 4.3) for Steven. \n\nIf we swap Dishwashing (Eve to Steven) and Laundry (Steven to Eve), the total time will be (4.5 + 2.9) for Eve and (4.3 + 7.2) for Steven. \n\nThe minimum total time is achieved when we swap Dishwashing (Eve to Steven) and Laundry (Steven to Eve), which is (4.5 + 2.9) for Eve and (4.3 + 7.2) for Steven.\n\nSo, the minimum total time spent on chores will be the maximum of these two times, which is max((4.5 + 2.9), (4.3 + 7.2)).",
        "First, we need to create two lists: one for the tasks each individual can perform and another for the time it will take for each individual to perform each task. For example, we can create two lists for Eve and Steven.\n\nSecond, we will iterate over each list and compare the time for each task between the two individuals.\n\nThird, we will assign the task to the person who can complete it in the shortest time. We will also keep track of the total time spent.\n\nFinally, we will sum up the total time spent by both individuals to get the minimum time spent to do the chores.\n\nLet's write the python code for this.",
        "1. First, let's identify the tasks that each person can do faster. \n2. For Marketing, Eve can do it faster (4.5 hours) compared to Steven (4.9 hours).\n3. For Cooking, Steven can do it faster (7.2 hours) compared to Eve (7.8 hours).\n4. For Dishwashing, Eve can do it faster (3.6 hours) compared to Steven (4.3 hours).\n5. For Laundry, Eve can do it faster (2.9 hours) compared to Steven (3.1 hours).\n\nNow, each person has to do two tasks. We want to assign the tasks in such a way that the total time spent is minimum.\n\n1. Let's assign Marketing to Eve and Cooking to Steven since they are the fastest in these tasks. Now, Eve has 1 task and Steven has 1 task.\n2. Now, we have to assign Dishwashing and Laundry. We can assign Dishwashing to Eve and Laundry to Steven. The total time spent would be minimum.\n\nTotal time spent = Time spent by Eve on Marketing + Time spent by Steven on Cooking + Time spent by Eve on Dishwashing + Time spent by Steven on Laundry\n\nThis will give us the minimum time spent to do the chores."
