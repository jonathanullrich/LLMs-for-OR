He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's start by identifying the problem type. This is a variant of the \"Chinese Postman Problem\" also known as \"Route Inspection Problem\" which is an optimization problem in graph theory. We need to find a shortest closed path (or circuit) that visits every edge (street in this case) of a (connected, undirected) graph at least once.\n\nNow, let's see the graph:\n\n- Vertices (or points): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\n- Edges (or streets): AB, AC, BC, BD, DE, DF, EF, EG, FG, GH\n\nNext, let's check the degrees of the vertices. In a graph theory, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. For a circuit to exist, all vertices should have an even degree. If some vertices have odd degrees, we'll need to duplicate some edges (streets) to make them even.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- A: degree 2 (AB, AC)\n- B: degree 3 (AB, BC, BD)\n- C: degree 2 (AC, BC)\n- D: degree 3 (BD, DE, DF)\n- E: degree 3 (DE, EF, EG)\n- F: degree 3 (DF, EF, FG)\n- G: degree 3 (EG, FG, GH)\n- H: degree 1 (GH)\n\nWe see that vertices B, D, E, F, G, and H have odd degrees. Since we need to start and end at point A, we'll duplicate the shortest edges connected to these vertices until all vertices have even degrees. The duplicated edges will add extra length to the route.\n\nLet's duplicate:\n\n- BD (length 4) to make B even\n- DE (length 3) to make D and E even\n- FG (length 5) to make F and G even\n- GH (length 3) twice to make H even\n\nNow, all vertices have even degrees. The extra length added is 4 + 3 + 5 + 3*2 = 18.\n\nNext, we can solve the problem as a Eulerian circuit problem. In a Eulerian circuit, we visit every edge exactly once. Since all vertices now have even degrees, such a circuit is guaranteed to exist. The length of this circuit is simply the sum of the lengths of all edges, including the duplicated ones.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- Total length of all edges: 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 38\n- Length of the duplicated edges: 18\n- Length of the Eulerian circuit: 38 + 18 = 56\n\nSo, the minimal length to walk through all the streets is 56.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
