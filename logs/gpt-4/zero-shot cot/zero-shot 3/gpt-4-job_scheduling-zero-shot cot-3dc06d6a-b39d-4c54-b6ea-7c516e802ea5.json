    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to consider the due times of the jobs to determine the order in which they should be processed. \n\nGiven that the jobs need to be completed by the end of a certain day, we can set a priority order based on these due times. Here, Job 2 has the shortest due time, so it should be processed first. Then, Job 1 should be processed second since it has the next shortest due time. Job 3 should be processed third, and finally, Job 4 should be processed last because it has the longest due time.\n\nAfter determining the order, we add up the processing times of the jobs in this order to get the minimal time to process all jobs. \n\nLet's calculate this. \n\n\n```python\n# Processing times for the jobs\nprocessing_times = [6, 4, 5, 8]\n\n# Order of jobs based on due times\norder_of_jobs = [2, 1, 3, 4]\n\n# Initialize minimal time\nminimal_time = 0\n\n# Calculate minimal time\nfor job in order_of_jobs:\n    minimal_time += processing_times[job-1]\n\n# minimal_time is the solution\nsolution = minimal_time\n```\nThe above Python code will give us the minimal time to process all jobs. Note that we have to subtract 1 from the job number in the loop because Python uses zero-based indexing.",
