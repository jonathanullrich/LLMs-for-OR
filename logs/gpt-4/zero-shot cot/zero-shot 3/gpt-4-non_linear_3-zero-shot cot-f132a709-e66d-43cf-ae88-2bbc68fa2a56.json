    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",

    "output": "First, we need to determine how many blocks of Stock 1 and Stock 2 Richard should recommend Ann to purchase to achieve a 15% return on her investment while minimizing risk. \n\nSince the price per block is $20 for Stock 1 and $30 for Stock 2, and the expected returns per block are 5 for Stock 1 and 10 for Stock 2, we can set up the following two equations:\n\n20x + 30y \u2264 50 (the total cost of the stocks cannot exceed $50,000)\n5x + 10y \u2265 15 (the total return on the stocks should be at least 15%)\n\nwhere x is the number of blocks of Stock 1 and y is the number of blocks of Stock 2. \n\nHowever, we also need to consider the risk, which is represented by the variance of the return on each block. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for Stock 1 and 100 for Stock 2, and the covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. \n\nThe total risk, R, can be represented as follows:\n\nR = 4x^2 + 100y^2 + 2*5xy\n\nWe want to minimize this risk.\n\nThis is a quadratic programming problem, which can be solved using Python and the CVXPY library. \n\nLet's write a Python program to solve this problem. \n\n```python\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n# Define the variables\nx = cp.Variable()  # number of blocks of Stock 1\ny = cp.Variable()  # number of blocks of Stock 2\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [\n    20*x + 30*y <= 50,  # total cost of the stocks cannot exceed $50,000\n    5*x + 10*y >= 15  # total return on the stocks should be at least 15%\n]\n\n# Define the objective function\nrisk = 4*x**2 + 100*y**2 + 2*5*x*y\nobjective = cp.Minimize(risk)\n\n# Define the problem\nproblem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\n\n# Solve the problem\nproblem.solve()\n\n# Get the solution\nsolution = problem.value\n```\n\nNote: This problem is a quadratic programming problem because the objective function is a quadratic function and the constraints are linear. Quadratic programming problems can be solved using various methods, including interior-point methods and active-set methods. The CVXPY library uses the ECOS solver by default, which is an interior-point method.",
