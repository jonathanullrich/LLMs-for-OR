Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to create a list of all possible permutations of the four swimmers. \n\nThen, we calculate the total time for each permutation by summing up the best times of each swimmer for their assigned stroke.\n\nFinally, we find the minimum total time from all the permutations. \n\nWe can use the itertools library in Python to generate the permutations and the min function to find the minimum time. However, this process might be time-consuming if the number of swimmers and strokes is large. For this problem, it is manageable as we only have 5 swimmers and 4 strokes. \n\nLet's write Python code to do this. \n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Each swimmer's best time for each stroke\ntimes = {\n    'Carl': {'Backstroke': 37.7, 'Breaststroke': 43.4, 'Butterfly': 33.3, 'Freestyle': 29.2},\n    'Chris': {'Backstroke': 32.9, 'Breaststroke': 33.1, 'Butterfly': 28.5, 'Freestyle': 26.4},\n    'David': {'Backstroke': 33.8, 'Breaststroke': 42.2, 'Butterfly': 38.9, 'Freestyle': 29.6},\n    'Tony': {'Backstroke': 37.0, 'Breaststroke': 34.7, 'Butterfly': 30.4, 'Freestyle': 28.5},\n    'Ken': {'Backstroke': 35.4, 'Breaststroke': 41.8, 'Butterfly': 33.6, 'Freestyle': 31.1}\n}\n\n# All possible permutations of the four swimmers\nswimmers = ['Carl', 'Chris', 'David', 'Tony', 'Ken']\nstrokes = ['Backstroke', 'Breaststroke', 'Butterfly', 'Freestyle']\npermutations = list(itertools.permutations(swimmers, len(strokes)))\n\n# Calculate the total time for each permutation and find the minimum\nmin_time = float('inf')\nfor permutation in permutations:\n    total_time = sum(times[swimmer][stroke] for swimmer, stroke in zip(permutation, strokes))\n    if total_time < min_time:\n        min_time = total_time\n\nsolution = min_time\n```\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that each swimmer can only be assigned to one stroke, which seems to be the case based on the problem statement.", "code": "import itertools\n\n# Each swimmer's best time for each stroke\ntimes = {\n    'Carl': {'Backstroke': 37.7, 'Breaststroke': 43.4, 'Butterfly': 33.3, 'Freestyle': 29.2},\n    'Chris': {'Backstroke': 32.9, 'Breaststroke': 33.1, 'Butterfly': 28.5, 'Freestyle': 26.4},\n    'David': {'Backstroke': 33.8, 'Breaststroke': 42.2, 'Butterfly': 38.9, 'Freestyle': 29.6},\n    'Tony': {'Backstroke': 37.0, 'Breaststroke': 34.7, 'Butterfly': 30.4, 'Freestyle': 28.5},\n    'Ken': {'Backstroke': 35.4, 'Breaststroke': 41.8, 'Butterfly': 33.6, 'Freestyle': 31.1}\n}\n\n# All possible permutations of the four swimmers\nswimmers = ['Carl', 'Chris', 'David', 'Tony', 'Ken']\nstrokes = ['Backstroke', 'Breaststroke', 'Butterfly', 'Freestyle']\npermutations = list(itertools.permutations(swimmers, len(strokes)))\n\n# Calculate the total time for each permutation and find the minimum\nmin_time = float('inf')\nfor permutation in permutations:\n    total_time = sum(times[swimmer][stroke] for swimmer, stroke in zip(permutation, strokes))\n    if total_time < min_time:\n        min_time = total_time\n\nsolution = min_time", "solution": 126.2}
