    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",

    "output": "First, let's denote the number of pints Tom buys from Dick today as x, and the number he buys tomorrow as y. Similarly, let's denote the number of pints Tom buys from Harry today as a, and the number he buys tomorrow as b.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n1. x + a = 3 (Tom wants to buy 3 pints today)\n2. y + b = 4 (Tom wants to buy 4 pints tomorrow)\n3. x + y <= 5 (Dick can sell at most 5 pints)\n4. a + b <= 4 (Harry can sell at most 4 pints)\n\nTom wants to minimize his total cost, which is given by the equation:\nC = 3x + 2.7y + 2.9a + 2.8b\n\nWe can solve this as a linear programming problem in Python using the scipy.optimize.linprog function, which minimizes a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\n\nThe code would be like this:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of the objective function\nc = [3, 2.7, 2.9, 2.8]\n\n# Coefficients of the inequality constraints (converted to <= form)\nA = [[1, 1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 1, 1],\n     [-1, -1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, -1, -1]]\n\nb = [5, 4, -3, -4]\n\n# Coefficients of the equality constraints\nA_eq = [[1, 0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 1]]\n\nb_eq = [3, 4]\n\n# Solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=b_eq, method='highs')\n\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nIn this code, `c` is the coefficients of the objective function, `A` and `b` are the coefficients of the inequality constraints, and `A_eq` and `b_eq` are the coefficients of the equality constraints. The `linprog` function returns an object that contains information about the solution, and `res.fun` is the minimum value of the objective function.",
