    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",

    "output": "Sure, let's first define the problem statement clearly:\n\n1. Luxor Travel needs 7, 4, 7, and 8 cars for the next 4 weeks respectively.\n2. The car rental agency charges $220 per car per week and $500 per rental transaction.\n3. Luxor Travel can choose to keep the cars for an additional week instead of returning them and paying the rental transaction fee again.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the total cost for Luxor Travel.\n\nTo minimize cost, the strategy should be to rent as many cars as needed for the longest continuous duration, to avoid paying the additional $500 transaction fee.\n\nHere is a python code snippet to calculate the cost:\n\n```python\ndef calc_cost(weeks):\n    total_cost = 0\n    for i in range(len(weeks)):\n        if i == 0 or weeks[i] < weeks[i-1]:\n            total_cost += weeks[i]*220 + 500\n        else:\n            total_cost += weeks[i]*220\n    return total_cost\n\nweeks = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nsolution = calc_cost(weeks)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the minimal cost for Luxor Travel to rent the cars.",
