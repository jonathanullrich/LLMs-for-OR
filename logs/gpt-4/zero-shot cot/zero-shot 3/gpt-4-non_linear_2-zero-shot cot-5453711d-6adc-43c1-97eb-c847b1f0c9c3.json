    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The optimum location is sought for an airfield from which the six airfields A to F can be approached. The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Firstly, in this problem we need to find the optimal location for a new airfield. This location should minimize the sum of the daily flight kilometers to the other airfields (A to F). This is essentially an optimization problem.\n\nSecondly, the restrictions given in the problem (the swamp area and the lake) can be viewed as constraints in this optimization problem. We need to find the optimal location that also satisfies these constraints.\n\nOne approach to solve this problem is to use a method called 'weighted centroid'. The centroid is the average of the positions (coordinates) of all the airfields, and the weighted centroid is the average of the positions weighted by the number of flights. However, this method does not account for the constraints.\n\nAnother approach is to use an optimization algorithm that can handle constraints, such as the 'Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation' (COBYLA) method. This algorithm can find the minimum of a function subject to constraints.\n\nHere is a python script to solve the problem using the COBYLA method:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# coordinates and number of flights\ncoords = np.array([[40, 200], [160, 210], [250, 160], [220, 80], [100, 40], [30, 100]])\nflights = np.array([40, 10, 20, 30, 20, 10])\n\n# objective function: sum of distances times number of flights\ndef objective(x):\n    return np.sum(np.sqrt(np.sum((coords - x)**2, axis=1)) * flights)\n\n# constraints: swamp area and lake\nconstraints = (\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 250 - (x[0] + x[1])},\n    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 400 - ((x[0] - 100)**2 + (x[1] - 100)**2)}\n)\n\n# initial guess\nx0 = np.array([100, 100])\n\n# minimize the objective function with constraints\nres = minimize(objective, x0, method='COBYLA', constraints=constraints)\n\n# print the result\nprint(res)\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nThis script calculates the minimum sum of daily flight kilometers and the coordinates of the optimal location.\n\nNote: The swamp and lake constraints are formulated as inequalities. The 'ineq' type means that the constraint function should be greater than or equal to zero. In other words, the sum of the coordinates should be less than 250 for the swamp constraint, and the distance to the point (100, 100) should be less than 20 for the lake constraint (since the radius of the lake is the square root of 400, which is 20).",
