    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to determine which tasks each person is faster at. \n\nEve is faster at Marketing (4.5 hours compared to Steven's 4.9), Dishwashing (3.6 hours compared to Steven's 4.3), and Laundry (2.9 hours compared to Steven's 3.1). Steven is faster at Cooking (7.2 hours compared to Eve's 7.8).\n\nThe next step is to determine which tasks to assign to each person. Since each person must perform two tasks, it makes sense to give each person the tasks they can perform the fastest.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the total time spent. Here are the options:\n\n- If Eve does Marketing and Dishwashing and Steven does Cooking and Laundry, the total time is 4.5 + 3.6 + 7.2 + 3.1 = 18.4 hours.\n- If Eve does Marketing and Laundry and Steven does Cooking and Dishwashing, the total time is 4.5 + 2.9 + 7.2 + 4.3 = 18.9 hours.\n- If Eve does Dishwashing and Laundry and Steven does Cooking and Marketing, the total time is 3.6 + 2.9 + 7.2 + 4.9 = 18.6 hours.\n\nSo, the minimum time is 18.4 hours if Eve does Marketing and Dishwashing while Steven does Cooking and Laundry.",
