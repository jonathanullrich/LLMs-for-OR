    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Sure. To find the total profit, we need to maximize the sum of the profits from both products, given the constraint that the total production rate cannot exceed two units per hour. \n\nFor Product 1, the profit function is $200*R1 - $100*R1^2, and for Product 2, the profit function is $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. \n\nSo, the total profit function we want to maximize is $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 + $300*R2 - $100*R2^2.\n\nThis is subject to the constraint that R1 + R2 \u2264 2, which means the sum of the production rates for both products cannot exceed two units per hour.\n\nSince we are dealing with a quadratic function, we can find the maximum value by taking the derivative of the function and setting it equal to zero. \n\nTherefore, we need to derive the profit function with respect to R1 and R2, set them equal to zero, and then solve for R1 and R2. \n\nSo let's do this in the next step.",
