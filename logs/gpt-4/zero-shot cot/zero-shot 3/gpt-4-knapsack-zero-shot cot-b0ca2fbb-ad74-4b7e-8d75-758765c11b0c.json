    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to create a list for each item where each item is represented as a tuple of two values - volume and value. The volume of the item is the amount of space it will take in the backpack and the value is the hiker's estimation of its importance. We'll have three items, so we'll have three tuples.\n\nNext, we need to sort the items by their value to volume ratio in descending order. This will ensure that we consider items with the highest value per volume unit first.\n\nAfter sorting the items, we start filling the backpack. We take the item with the highest value to volume ratio and check if it fits into the backpack. If it does, we add it to the backpack and subtract its volume from the remaining volume of the backpack. We continue this process until we can't fit any more items into the backpack.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total value of the items in the backpack which is our optimal solution. \n\nLet's write the code to solve this problem. \n\n```python\n# List of items, each represented as a tuple (volume, value)\nitems = [(2, 30), (3, 50), (4, 70)]\n\n# Sort items by value to volume ratio in descending order\nitems.sort(key=lambda item: item[1]/item[0], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize backpack volume and total value\nbackpack_volume = 5\ntotal_value = 0\n\n# Fill the backpack\nfor item in items:\n    if backpack_volume >= item[0]:\n        # Item fits into the backpack\n        backpack_volume -= item[0]\n        total_value += item[1]\n\nsolution = total_value\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' contains the optimal solution to this problem.",
