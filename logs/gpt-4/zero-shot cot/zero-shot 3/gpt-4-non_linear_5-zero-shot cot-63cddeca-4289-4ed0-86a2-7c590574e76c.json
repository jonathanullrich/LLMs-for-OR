    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "This problem is a type of linear programming problem where you want to maximize a certain objective (in this case, profit) subject to certain constraints. Python's `scipy` library has a method called `linprog` which can be used to solve such problems. \n\nHowever, `linprog` method minimizes the objective function by default. So, we need to convert the maximization problem into a minimization problem by multiplying the profit with -1.\n\nLet's define profit for each product as follows:\n\n- For Product 1: Profit = 360*x1 for x1 <= 15, Profit = 360*15 + 30*(x1 - 15) for x1 > 15\n- For Product 2: Profit = 240*x2 for x2 <= 20, Profit = 240*20 + 120*(x2 - 20) for x2 <= 40, Profit = 240*20 + 120*20 + 90*(x2 - 40) for x2 > 40\n- For Product 3: Profit = 450*x3 for x3 <= 20, Profit = 450*20 + 300*(x3 - 20) for x3 <= 30, Profit = 450*20 + 300*10 + 180*(x3 - 30) for x3 > 30\n\nThe constraints are:\n\n- x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\n- 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200\n- x1 + 2*x3 <= 70\n\nAlso, x1, x2, x3 >= 0 because you can't produce negative units.\n\nFirst, let's import the required libraries and define our objective function and constraints. Then we can use `linprog` to solve the problem. \n\nPlease note that you might not get an integer solution because `linprog` solves the problem in the real number space by default. If you want an integer solution, you might need to use a library or method that supports integer linear programming.",
