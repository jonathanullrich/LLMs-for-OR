    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Sure, here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Define the decision variables: Let's denote x1 and x2 as the number of units of product 1 and product 2 respectively to be produced.\n\n2. Construct the objective function: The objective is to maximize the profit. The profit from product 1 is $1 per unit and from product 2 is $2 per unit (up to 60 units). So, the objective function becomes: Maximize P = x1 + 2*x2.\n\n3. Construct the constraints: The constraints are based on the available resources (frame parts and electrical components). From the problem, we have:\n\n- For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required.\n- For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required.\n- The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components.\n\nSo, the constraints are:\n\n- x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (frame parts constraint)\n- 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (electrical components constraint)\n- x2 <= 60 (Profit from product 2 is only till 60 units)\n\n4. Solve the problem: We can use any standard linear programming solver to solve this problem.\n\nLet's implement these steps in python code below:",
