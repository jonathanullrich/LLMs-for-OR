Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to define the problem as an optimization problem. We have:\n\n1. Decision variables: The number of blocks of each stock that Ann should buy. We'll denote these as x1 and x2 for stocks 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n2. Objective function: Since Ann wants to minimize risk, our objective function should be the variance of the portfolio, which is a measure of risk. In terms of our variables, this is 4*x1^2 + 100*x2^2 + 2*5*x1*x2.\n\n3. Constraints: \n   - Ann has a budget of $50,000. In terms of our units, this is 50 blocks. Each block of stock 1 costs 20 units and each block of stock 2 costs 30 units. So, we have the constraint 20*x1 + 30*x2 <= 50.\n   - Ann wants a return of at least 15%. In terms of our units, this is 15 blocks. The return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. So, we have the constraint 5*x1 + 10*x2 >= 15.\n   \nWe can solve this optimization problem using a quadratic programming solver. We will use the cvxpy library in Python.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
