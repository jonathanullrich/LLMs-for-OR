{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's solve it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Define the problem in terms of mathematical equations.\n\nWe need to minimize the cost function:\nC = 3D1 + 2.7D2 + 2.9H1 + 2.8H2 \n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\nD1 + H1 >= 3 (Tom's requirement for today)\nD2 + H2 >= 4 (Tom's requirement for tomorrow)\nD1 + D2 <= 5 (Dick's maximum supply)\nH1 + H2 <= 4 (Harry's maximum supply)\n\nWhere:\nD1 = pints bought from Dick today\nD2 = pints bought from Dick tomorrow\nH1 = pints bought from Harry today\nH2 = pints bought from Harry tomorrow\n\nStep 2: Solve the problem using a linear programming package in python.\n\nFor simplicity, we can use the PuLP package, which is a free open source software written in Python. It is used to describe optimization problems as mathematical models. PuLP can then call any of numerous external LP solvers (CBC, GLPK, CPLEX, Gurobi etc) to solve this model and then use python commands to manipulate and display the solution.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
