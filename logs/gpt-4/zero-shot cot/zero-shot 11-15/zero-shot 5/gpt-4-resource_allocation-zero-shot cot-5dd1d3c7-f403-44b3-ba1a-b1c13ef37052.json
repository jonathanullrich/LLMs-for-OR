Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "The cost to rent cars for a week is $220 per car. The cost to keep a rental for an additional week is also $220 per car. The cost to initiate any new rental transaction is $500.\n\nLet's break down the car needs week by week:\n\n1. Week 1: Luxor Travel needs 7 cars. This will cost 7 cars * $220 per car + $500 transaction fee = $2040.\n\n2. Week 2: Luxor Travel needs 4 cars. Instead of returning 3 cars and having to rent 4 cars, it would be cheaper for them to keep all 7 cars. This will cost 7 cars * $220 per car = $1540.\n\n3. Week 3: Luxor Travel needs 7 cars. They already have 7 cars, so the cost is simply the rental fee for those cars. This will be 7 cars * $220 per car = $1540.\n\n4. Week 4: Luxor Travel needs 8 cars. They already have 7 cars, but they need to rent one more. This will cost 7 cars * $220 per car + $500 transaction fee + 1 car * $220 = $2040.\n\nTo find the minimal cost, we simply add up these weekly costs: $2040 + $1540 + $1540 + $2040 = $7160. So the minimal cost is $7160.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
