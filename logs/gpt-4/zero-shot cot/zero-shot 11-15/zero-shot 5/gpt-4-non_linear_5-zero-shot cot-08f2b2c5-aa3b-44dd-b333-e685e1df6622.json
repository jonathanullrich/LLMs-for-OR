Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we will need to formulate this problem as a linear programming problem.\n\nLet's denote the profit from the first 15 units of product 1 as P1, the profit from additional units of product 1 as A1. Similarly, we can denote the profit from the first 20 units of product 2 as P2, the next 20 units as N2, and additional units as A2. For product 3, we can denote the profit from the first 20 units as P3, the next 10 units as N3, and additional units as A3.\n\nSo the total profit from the production can be written as:\n\nP = P1*x1 + A1*(x1-15) + P2*x2 + N2*(x2-20) + A2*(x2-40) + P3*x3 + N3*(x3-20) + A3*(x3-30)\n\nThe constraints on the production can be written as:\n\nx1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\n3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200\nx1 + 2*x3 <= 70\n\nWe want to maximize P subject to these constraints.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem that can be solved using the scipy.optimize.linprog function in Python.\n\nHere is a Python code snippet that solves this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\nc = [-360, -30, -240, -120, -90, -450, -300, -180]\nA = [[1, -15, 1, -20, -40, 1, -20, -30], \n     [3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n     [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]\nb = [60, 200, 70]\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (15, None)\nx2_bounds = (0, None)\nx3_bounds = (20, None)\nx4_bounds = (40, None)\nx5_bounds = (0, None)\nx6_bounds = (20, None)\nx7_bounds = (30, None)\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds, x2_bounds, x3_bounds, x4_bounds, x5_bounds, x6_bounds, x7_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = res.x\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will print the optimal values of x1, x2, and x3 that maximize the total profit.\n\nHowever, the problem is a little tricky due to the different unit profits for different products and quantities.
