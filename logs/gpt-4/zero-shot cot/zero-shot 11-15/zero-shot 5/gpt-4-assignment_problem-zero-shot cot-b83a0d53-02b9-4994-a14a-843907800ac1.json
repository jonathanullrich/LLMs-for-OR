    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.",

    "output": "Sure, first, we need to understand that this problem is an assignment problem. The objective is to assign swimmers to the four different strokes in a way that the total time is minimized. \n\nThis problem can be solved by using the Hungarian algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm or the Munkres assignment algorithm. \n\nThis algorithm constructs an n\u00d7n cost matrix where n is the number of swimmers or strokes. Each entry in the matrix represents the cost of assigning a swimmer to a stroke. The algorithm then finds the optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's start by creating a cost matrix where each row represents a swimmer and each column represents a stroke:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\ncost = np.array([[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n                 [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n                 [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n                 [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n                 [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]) # Ken\n```\n\nThen, we can use the `linear_sum_assignment` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve the assignment problem:\n```\nrow_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)\nsolution = cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()\n```",
