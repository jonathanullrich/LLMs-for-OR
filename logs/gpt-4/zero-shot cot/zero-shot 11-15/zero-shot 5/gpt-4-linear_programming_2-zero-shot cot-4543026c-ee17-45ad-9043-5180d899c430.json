{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.", "examples": null, "output": "Okay, sure. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFirstly, we have to understand that this is an optimization problem where we want to maximize our profit. We have certain constraints in terms of investment money and time. \n\nWe have $12,000 to invest and maximum of 600 hours to work in summer. \nWe can invest in Friend 1's venture where full partnership would need $10,000 and 400 hours with a profit of $9,000.\nOr we can invest in Friend 2's venture where full partnership would need $8,000 and 500 hours with a profit of $9,000.\n\nThe most important thing to note is that we can choose any fraction of a full partnership. Meaning, we do not necessarily have to invest the full amount or put in the full time. We can choose a fraction and all the values (investment, time and profit) would be multiplied by this fraction.\n\nSo, we need to find out what fraction to invest in each friend's venture so that we can maximize our total profit. \n\nThis problem can be solved using linear programming. Linear Programming is a mathematical technique where we optimize a linear objective function subject to a set of linear inequality or equality constraints. \n\nIn this case, our objective function is to maximize profit and our constraints are the amount of money we can invest and the time we can put in. \n\nLet's denote the fraction of investment in Friend 1's venture as x and in Friend 2's venture as y. \n\nWe want to maximize:\nProfit = 9000x + 9000y\n\nSubject to the constraints:\nMoney: 10000x + 8000y <= 12000\nTime: 400x + 500y <= 600\n\nAlso, fractions cannot be negative so, x >= 0 and y >= 0.\n\nWe can write a python program using scipy's linprog function to solve this problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
