The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we need to order the jobs by their deadlines. The deadlines are as follows:\n\nJob 2: Day 4\nJob 1: Day 8\nJob 3: Day 12\nJob 4: Day 16\n\nGiven the processing times, we can see that Job 2 must be started first, since it has the earliest deadline and takes 4 days to complete. Next, Job 1 is started, which adds 6 days to our total processing time. After Job 1 is finished, we start Job 3, which adds 5 days, and finally Job 4, which adds 8 days.\n\nLet's add up these processing times: 4 (Job 2) + 6 (Job 1) + 5 (Job 3) + 8 (Job 4) = 23 days.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time to process the jobs is 23 days. \n\nSo, solution = 23.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
