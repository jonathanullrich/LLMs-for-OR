    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A Postman has to walk through each street at least once when delivering letters. He must start and end at Point A. He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to identify the nodes (points) with odd degree (number of streets connected to it). Those are the nodes the postman has to go through multiple times. The starting point, A, is an exception since he starts and ends there. In this case, the nodes with odd degree are A, B, D, and G. \n\nNow, we need to find the shortest path between these nodes. To do that, we utilize Dijkstra's algorithm and generate a new graph with these nodes and their shortest paths.\n\nFinally, we need to find the minimum-weight perfect matching in the new graph, which means we need to pair up the nodes so that the sum of the length of the paths between the pairs is minimal. We can use the Blossom algorithm to find this.\n\nLet's add these extra distances to the total length of all streets (which the postman must walk through) and we get the minimum length he must walk.\n\nPlease note: This problem is a variation of the Chinese postman problem (also called route inspection problem), which is known in graph theory. This solution assumes knowledge of several algorithms in this field, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths and the Blossom algorithm for finding minimum-weight perfect matchings. If you're not familiar with these concepts, you may need to do some research to understand them.",
