Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": "First, let's create a dictionary where the keys are the projects and the values are the list of employees working on them. This will help to easily identify the common projects among employees. Here is a possible way to create this dictionary:\n\n```python\nprojects = {\n    1: [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10],\n    2: [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8],\n    4: [1, 3, 4, 8, 10],\n    5: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10],\n    6: [3, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n}\n```\n\nNext step is to schedule the meetings. The manager should start with the project that involves the most employees, because this will reduce the number of employees entering and leaving the meeting room. In case of a tie, the manager can choose any of the projects.\n\nIf there are still employees not involved in a meeting, the manager should choose the next project that involves the most of these employees, and so on, until all employees have been involved in a meeting.\n\nThe number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room is the number of employees involved in a project minus the number of employees who were involved in the previous project and are also involved in the current project.\n\nHere is a possible Python code to schedule the meetings and calculate the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room:\n\n```python\nsolution = 0\nprevious_employees = []\n\nwhile projects:\n    # Find the project with the most employees\n    max_project = max(projects, key=lambda x: len(projects[x]))\n    current_employees = projects[max_project]\n\n    # Calculate the number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\n    solution += len(current_employees) - len([e for e in previous_employees if e in current_employees])\n\n    # Remove the project from the dictionary\n    del projects[max_project]\n\n    # Update the list of employees in the previous meeting\n    previous_employees = current_employees\n\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code assumes that the input is correct, i.e., each employee works on at least one project and each project involves at least one employee. It also assumes that the input dictionary `projects` is not needed after the code is run, because it is modified by the code.", "code": "projects = {\n    1: [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10],\n    2: [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8],\n    4: [1, 3, 4, 8, 10],\n    5: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10],\n    6: [3, 6, 7, 9, 10]\n}\nsolution = 0\nprevious_employees = []\n\nwhile projects:\n    # Find the project with the most employees\n    max_project = max(projects, key=lambda x: len(projects[x]))\n    current_employees = projects[max_project]\n\n    # Calculate the number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room\n    solution += len(current_employees) - len([e for e in previous_employees if e in current_employees])\n\n    # Remove the project from the dictionary\n    del projects[max_project]\n\n    # Update the list of employees in the previous meeting\n    previous_employees = current_employees\n\nprint(solution)", "solution": 20}
