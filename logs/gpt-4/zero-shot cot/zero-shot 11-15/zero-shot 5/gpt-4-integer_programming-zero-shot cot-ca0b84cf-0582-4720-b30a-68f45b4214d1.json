    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to identify who is more efficient at each task. Eve is more efficient at marketing (4.5 hours vs 4.9), dishwashing (3.6 hours vs 4.3), and laundry (2.9 hours vs 3.1), while Steven is more efficient at cooking (7.2 hours vs 7.8). \n\nNext, we need to divide the tasks in such a way that each person does two chores, and the total time spent is minimized. Since Eve is more efficient at three tasks, she should definitely take two of them. The most time-consuming task is cooking, which Steven is more efficient at, so he should definitely take that one. \n\nThe second task for Steven should be the one that Eve is less efficient at among the remaining three. That's marketing, which takes 4.9 hours for him. So, Steven will do cooking and marketing.\n\nEve will then take the two remaining tasks, dishwashing and laundry. \n\nSo, the minimum total time spent on chores will be 7.2 (Steven cooking) + 4.9 (Steven marketing) + 3.6 (Eve dishwashing) + 2.9 (Eve laundry) = 18.6 hours.",
