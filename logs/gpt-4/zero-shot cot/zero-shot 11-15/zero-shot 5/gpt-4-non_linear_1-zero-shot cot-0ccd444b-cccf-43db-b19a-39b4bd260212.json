Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "The tax revenue is given by the product of the tax rate, the base price per cigarette, and the average daily consumption per smoker. \n\nSo, the tax revenue function R(t) = t * 0.15 * (53 - 100*(t/100)).\n\nTo find the maximum of this function, we can take the derivative with respect to t, set it equal to zero, and solve for t. \n\nLet's write the python code for this. \n\nFirst, we need to define the function and its derivative. \n\nThen, we will use a numerical method to find the root of the derivative. We can use the scipy library's optimize module for this.\n\nFinally, we will check that the second derivative at this point is negative to ensure that it is indeed a maximum.\n\nLet's write the python code now.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
