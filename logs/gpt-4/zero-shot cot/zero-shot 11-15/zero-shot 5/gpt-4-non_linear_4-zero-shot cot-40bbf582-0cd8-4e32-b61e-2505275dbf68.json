{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, first we need to establish the constraints and objective function for this problem.\n\nConstraints:\n1. We know that the total production cannot exceed 2 units per hour. Therefore, R1 + R2 <= 2\n\nObjective:\n1. We want to maximize the profit which is given by the equations, $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 for product 1 and $300*R2 - $100*R2^2 for product 2. The total profit can be obtained by adding these two.\n\nIn this case, we have a maximization problem with constraints. This type of problem can be solved by optimization techniques, like linear programming or other optimization algorithms.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
