Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "The tax revenue is the product of the tax rate, the base price per cigarette, and the number of cigarettes consumed per day. So we can write a function for tax revenue R = t * 0.15 * (53 - 100*(t/100)). \n\nTo find the tax rate that maximizes tax revenue, we can take the derivative of the revenue function and set it equal to zero, then solve for t. \n\nHowever, since we are dealing with a quadratic function, we know that it is symmetric, and its maximum will be at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a function in the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b/(2a), so we can apply this formula to our revenue function to find the maximum. \n\nIn this case, a = -0.15*100/100 = -1.5 and b = 0.15*53 = 7.95. The x-coordinate of the vertex is -b/(2a), so the tax rate that maximizes revenue is -7.95/(2*-1.5) = 2.65, or 265% when expressed as a percentage.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
