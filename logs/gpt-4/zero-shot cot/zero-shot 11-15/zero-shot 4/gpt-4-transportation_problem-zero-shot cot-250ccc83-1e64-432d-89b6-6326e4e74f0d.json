{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to define the variables:\n\n- x1: the number of pints Tom buys from Dick today.\n- x2: the number of pints Tom buys from Dick tomorrow.\n- y1: the number of pints Tom buys from Harry today.\n- y2: the number of pints Tom buys from Harry tomorrow.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the cost, which is $3.00*x1 + $2.70*x2 + $2.90*y1 + $2.80*y2.\n\nBut we also have constraints:\n\n- Tom's demand: x1 + y1 = 3 (for today), x2 + y2 = 4 (for tomorrow).\n- Dick's supply: x1 + x2 <= 5.\n- Harry's supply: y1 + y2 <= 4.\n\nWe can use linear programming to solve this problem. Let's write some Python code using PuLP, a Python library for linear programming.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
