{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, first we need to represent the data in a format that can be used to solve the problem. We can represent the data as a cost matrix where each row represents a swimmer and each column represents a stroke. The value at the i-th row and j-th column will represent the time taken by the i-th swimmer to swim the j-th stroke.\n\nNext, we need to find a way to assign each swimmer to a unique stroke such that the total time is minimized. This is a classic assignment problem which can be solved using the Hungarian Algorithm.\n\nLet's represent the data and solve the problem using Python.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
