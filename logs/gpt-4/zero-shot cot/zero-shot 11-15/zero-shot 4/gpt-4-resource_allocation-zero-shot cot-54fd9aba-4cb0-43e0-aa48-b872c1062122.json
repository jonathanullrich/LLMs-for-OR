Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "The cost for Luxor Travel to rent cars each week depends on the number of cars they need that week and whether or not they decide to continue renting from the previous week. \n\nIn the first week, they need 7 cars. Since this is the first week, they have to pay both the rental fee and the transaction fee: 7 * $220 + $500 = $2040.\n\nIn the second week, they need 4 cars. If they decide to keep the 7 cars from the previous week, they would pay: 7 * $220 = $1540. However, if they decide to return 3 cars and only keep 4, they would have to pay a new transaction fee: 4 * $220 + $500 = $1380. Therefore, it would be cheaper for them to return 3 cars and only keep 4.\n\nIn the third week, they need 7 cars. If they decide to keep the 4 cars from the previous week and rent 3 more, they would pay: 7 * $220 + $500 = $2040. However, if they decide to return the 4 cars and rent 7 new ones, they would also have to pay: 7 * $220 + $500 = $2040. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether they keep the 4 cars or return them, the cost would be the same.\n\nIn the fourth week, they need 8 cars. If they decide to keep the 7 cars from the previous week and rent 1 more, they would pay: 8 * $220 + $500 = $2260. However, if they decide to return the 7 cars and rent 8 new ones, they would also have to pay: 8 * $220 + $500 = $2260. Therefore, it doesn't matter whether they keep the 7 cars or return them, the cost would be the same.\n\nTherefore, the minimal cost for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand is: $2040 (first week) + $1380 (second week) + $2040 (third week) + $2260 (fourth week) = $7720.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
