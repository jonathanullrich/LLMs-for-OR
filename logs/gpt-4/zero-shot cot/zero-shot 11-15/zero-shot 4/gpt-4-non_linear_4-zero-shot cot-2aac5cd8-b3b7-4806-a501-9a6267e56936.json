{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "Alright, we know that the total production cannot exceed two units per hour. It would be logical to maximize the profit by finding the optimal mix of products. \n\nThe profit function for each product is a quadratic equation, which means it will have a maximum value. For Product 1, this maximum is achieved when d(profit)/dR1 = 0. Similarly, for Product 2, the maximum is achieved when d(profit)/dR2 = 0.\n\nLet's differentiate these equations and find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize the profit for each product. Then we can find the total profit, given that the total production cannot exceed two units per hour.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
