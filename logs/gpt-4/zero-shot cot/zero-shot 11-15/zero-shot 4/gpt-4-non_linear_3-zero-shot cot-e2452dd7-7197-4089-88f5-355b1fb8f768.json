Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we need to express the amount invested in each stock as a fraction of the total. Let's denote the amount invested in the first stock as x (in units of $1,000) and the amount invested in the second stock as y (also in units of $1,000). So, x+y equals the total amount of Ann's investment, which is 50 (in units of $1,000). \n\nNext, we need to consider the return. Here, we use the expected return per block, which is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. Therefore, the total return is 5x + 10y. \n\nAnn wants a return of 15%, which is 0.15 * 50 = 7.5 (in units of $1,000). So, we have the equation 5x + 10y = 7.5.\n\nLastly, we need to minimize the risk, which is measured by the variance of the return. The variance of the return is 4x^2 + 100y^2 + 2*5xy = 4x^2 + 100y^2 + 10xy. \n\nSo, the problem can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\n\nMinimize: 4x^2 + 100y^2 + 10xy\nSubject to: \nx + y = 50\n5x + 10y = 7.5\n\nThis is a quadratic programming problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
