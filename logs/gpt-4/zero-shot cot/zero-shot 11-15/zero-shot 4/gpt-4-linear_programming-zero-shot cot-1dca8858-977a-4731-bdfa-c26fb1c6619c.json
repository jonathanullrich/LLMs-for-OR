{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": "This is a linear programming problem, which can be solved using python's scipy library's optimize.linprog() function. \n\nWe have two decision variables: \n- x1: the number of units of product 1 to produce\n- x2: the number of units of product 2 to produce\n\nWe want to maximize the total profit, which is equal to 1*x1 + 2*x2. However, in scipy's linprog function, it only supports minimization, therefore we can multiply the objective function by -1 to change the maximization problem into a minimization problem. \n\nThe constraints are: \n- For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. Therefore, x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (frame parts constraint) and 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (electrical components constraint).\n- Each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Therefore, x2 <= 60.\n\nWe also have the non-negative constraint on the decision variables, x1 >= 0 and x2 >= 0.\n\nNow we can set up the problem and solve it using scipy's linprog function.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
