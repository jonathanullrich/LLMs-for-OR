The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to find the weighted average of the x and y coordinates for the six airfields. The weight is the number of flights from each airfield. \n\nNext, we need to check if the calculated coordinates fall within the swamp area or the lake area. If they do, we need to adjust the coordinates until they fall outside those areas.\n\nFinally, we calculate the objective function value which is the sum of the daily flight kilometers. We use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between the optimal location and each of the six airfields. We multiply this distance by the number of flights from each airfield and sum up all these values to get the objective function value. \n\nLet's write this as a Python code. \n\nNote: This is a simplified solution and does not take into account the exact shape and boundaries of the swamp and lake areas. A more accurate solution would require a more complex algorithm or a simulation. \n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# coordinates and number of flights\nairfields = np.array([[40, 200, 40], [160, 210, 10], [250, 160, 20], [220, 80, 30], [100, 40, 20], [30, 100, 10]])\n\n# calculate weighted average of x and y coordinates\noptimal_location = np.average(airfields[:,:2], axis=0, weights=airfields[:,2])\n\n# check if optimal location is in the swamp area, if so adjust it\nif optimal_location[0] + optimal_location[1] >= 250:\n    optimal_location[1] = 250 - optimal_location[0]\n\n# check if optimal location is in the lake area, if so adjust it\nif (optimal_location[0] - 100)**2 + (optimal_location[1] - 100)**2 <= 400:\n    # move the point along the line y = 100 - (x - 100) until it's outside the lake\n    while (optimal_location[0] - 100)**2 + (optimal_location[1] - 100)**2 <= 400:\n        optimal_location[0] += 1\n        optimal_location[1] = 100 - (optimal_location[0] - 100)\n\n# calculate the objective function value\nsolution = np.sum(np.sqrt(np.sum((airfields[:,:2] - optimal_location)**2, axis=1)) * airfields[:,2])\n```\n\nThis code calculates the optimal location and the objective function value.", "code": "import numpy as np\n\n# coordinates and number of flights\nairfields = np.array([[40, 200, 40], [160, 210, 10], [250, 160, 20], [220, 80, 30], [100, 40, 20], [30, 100, 10]])\n\n# calculate weighted average of x and y coordinates\noptimal_location = np.average(airfields[:,:2], axis=0, weights=airfields[:,2])\n\n# check if optimal location is in the swamp area, if so adjust it\nif optimal_location[0] + optimal_location[1] >= 250:\n    optimal_location[1] = 250 - optimal_location[0]\n\n# check if optimal location is in the lake area, if so adjust it\nif (optimal_location[0] - 100)**2 + (optimal_location[1] - 100)**2 <= 400:\n    # move the point along the line y = 100 - (x - 100) until it's outside the lake\n    while (optimal_location[0] - 100)**2 + (optimal_location[1] - 100)**2 <= 400:\n        optimal_location[0] += 1\n        optimal_location[1] = 100 - (optimal_location[0] - 100)\n\n# calculate the objective function value\nsolution = np.sum(np.sqrt(np.sum((airfields[:,:2] - optimal_location)**2, axis=1)) * airfields[:,2])", "solution": 13989.914640495737}
