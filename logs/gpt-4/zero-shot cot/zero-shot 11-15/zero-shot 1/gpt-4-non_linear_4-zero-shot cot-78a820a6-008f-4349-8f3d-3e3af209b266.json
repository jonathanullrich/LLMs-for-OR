Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "Given that the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour, we can express it as: R1 + R2 <= 2. Also, since the production rate can't be negative, we have R1, R2 >= 0.\n\nThe total profit P from producing both products can be expressed as: P = (200*R1 - 100*R1^2) + (300*R2 - 100*R2^2)\n\nSince the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased, we want to maximize the total profit P.\n\nThis is a quadratic programming problem, which can be solved using optimization techniques or libraries. The aim is to find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize P, subject to the constraints.\n\nHere's Python code that uses the cvxpy library to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n# Define the variables\nR1 = cp.Variable()\nR2 = cp.Variable()\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [R1 + R2 <= 2, R1 >= 0, R2 >= 0]\n\n# Define the objective function\nprofit = 200*R1 - 100*cp.square(R1) + 300*R2 - 100*cp.square(R2)\nobjective = cp.Maximize(profit)\n\n# Define the problem\nproblem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolution = problem.solve()\n\nprint('The maximum total profit is:', solution)\n```\n\nThis code will output the maximum total profit that can be achieved given the constraints.", "code": "import cvxpy as cp\n\n# Define the variables\nR1 = cp.Variable()\nR2 = cp.Variable()\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [R1 + R2 <= 2, R1 >= 0, R2 >= 0]\n\n# Define the objective function\nprofit = 200*R1 - 100*cp.square(R1) + 300*R2 - 100*cp.square(R2)\nobjective = cp.Maximize(profit)\n\n# Define the problem\nproblem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolution = problem.solve()\n\nprint('The maximum total profit is:', solution)", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
