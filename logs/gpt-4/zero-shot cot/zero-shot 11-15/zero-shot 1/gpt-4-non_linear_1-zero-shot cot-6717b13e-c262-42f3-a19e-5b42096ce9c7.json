{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "First, the tax revenue is calculated as the price per cigarette times the number of cigarettes consumed times the tax rate. \n\nThis gives us the formula Revenue = (Base Price + Tax) * Demand = (0.15 + t) * (53 - t). \n\nWe want to find the value of t that maximizes this revenue. This function is a quadratic, so we can find the maximum by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero. \n\nLet's write python code to solve this derivative equation.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
