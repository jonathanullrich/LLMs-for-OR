He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to find a route that includes all the streets at least once. The sum of all street lengths gives us a starting point for the total length of the route. This is: 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 38.\n\nThe postman has to start and end at point A. However, there are four points (B, D, E, G) which have an odd number of streets connected to them. In a round trip, these points need to be visited an even number of times. Therefore, the postman will have to walk at least two of these streets again.\n\nTo minimize the total length, the postman should walk the two shortest streets connected to these points again. These are B-C with length 3 and D-F with length 4. \n\nTherefore, the minimum total length of the route is 38 + 3 + 4 = 45.\n\nThe route could be: A-B, B-C, C-A, A-C, C-B, B-D, D-E, E-F, F-D, D-F, F-G, G-E, E-G, G-H, H-G, G-F, F-D, D-B, B-A.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
