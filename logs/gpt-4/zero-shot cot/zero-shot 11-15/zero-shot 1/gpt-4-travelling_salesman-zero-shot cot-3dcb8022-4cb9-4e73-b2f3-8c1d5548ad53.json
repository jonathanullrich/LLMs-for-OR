Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's take it step by step.\n\nFirstly, we need to group the employees based on the projects they are working on. To do this, we can identify which employees are working on the same projects. For example, both employee 1 and employee 7 are working on project 2, so they can be grouped together. \n\nSecondly, we need to minimize the number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room. This implies that we should try to schedule meetings for employees working on the same projects at the same time.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to sort the projects based on the number of employees working on them, from most to least. Then, we can schedule meetings in this order. This way, we minimize the number of times an employee has to enter or leave the room, as they are likely to have meetings close together.\n\nWe can write a Python script to implement this strategy. The script would look something like this:\n\n```python\n# Define the projects each employee is working on\nemployees = {\n    1: [2, 4, 5],\n    2: [1, 3, 5],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    4: [3, 4, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3],\n    6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    7: [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    8: [1, 3, 4],\n    9: [5, 6],\n    10: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n\n# Create a list to store the number of employees working on each project\nprojects = {}\n\nfor employee, projects_list in employees.items():\n    for project in projects_list:\n        if project not in projects:\n            projects[project] = 1\n        else:\n            projects[project] += 1\n\n# Sort the projects based on the number of employees working on them\nsorted_projects = sorted(projects.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the number of employees entering or leaving the room\ntraffic = 0\n\nfor project, num_employees in sorted_projects:\n    # Each employee enters the room once for the meeting\n    traffic += num_employees\n    # Each employee except the last one leaves the room after the meeting\n    traffic += num_employees - 1\n\nsolution = traffic\n```\n\nNote that this strategy assumes that all employees are available at the same time and that the meeting room can accommodate all employees. If these assumptions do not hold, the strategy would need to be adjusted accordingly.", "code": "# Define the projects each employee is working on\nemployees = {\n    1: [2, 4, 5],\n    2: [1, 3, 5],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    4: [3, 4, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3],\n    6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    7: [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    8: [1, 3, 4],\n    9: [5, 6],\n    10: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\n}\n\n# Create a list to store the number of employees working on each project\nprojects = {}\n\nfor employee, projects_list in employees.items():\n    for project in projects_list:\n        if project not in projects:\n            projects[project] = 1\n        else:\n            projects[project] += 1\n\n# Sort the projects based on the number of employees working on them\nsorted_projects = sorted(projects.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the number of employees entering or leaving the room\ntraffic = 0\n\nfor project, num_employees in sorted_projects:\n    # Each employee enters the room once for the meeting\n    traffic += num_employees\n    # Each employee except the last one leaves the room after the meeting\n    traffic += num_employees - 1\n\nsolution = traffic", "solution": 64}
