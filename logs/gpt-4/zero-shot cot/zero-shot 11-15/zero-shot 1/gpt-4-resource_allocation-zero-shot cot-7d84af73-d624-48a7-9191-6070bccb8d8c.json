{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "First, let's calculate the total number of cars needed over the entire period, which is 7 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 26 cars.\n\nNow, there are a couple of options Luxor Travel could consider:\n\n1. Rent all 26 cars at the beginning of the 4 weeks and keep them for the entire period. This would cost 26 cars * $220/week * 4 weeks + $500 = $22,300.\n\n2. Rent exactly as many cars as needed each week. This would cost (7 cars * $220 + $500) + (4 cars * $220 + $500) + (7 cars * $220 + $500) + (8 cars * $220 + $500) = $11,540.\n\nThe other options involve some combination of the two strategies above, but it is clear from these calculations that renting exactly as many cars as needed each week is the minimum cost.\n\nTherefore, the minimum cost for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation is $11,540.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
