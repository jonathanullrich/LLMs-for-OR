Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to setup the problem using the given information. \n\nWe have two stocks, each with its own price, expected return and variance. Ann would like to achieve a return of 15 percent on her total investment. \n\nWe can write the expected return as a sum of the weighted returns of each stock:\n\n0.15 * total_investment = x1 * return1 + x2 * return2\n\nwhere x1 and x2 are the amount of money invested in stock1 and stock2 respectively, return1 and return2 are the expected returns of stock1 and stock2 respectively, and total_investment is the total amount of money invested. \n\nThe total investment is the sum of the money invested in each stock: \n\ntotal_investment = x1 + x2\n\nWe also have a constraint on the total amount of money available for investment:\n\nx1 + x2 <= 50,000\n\nAnd since we cannot invest negative amounts of money:\n\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\n\nWe can also write the variance of the portfolio as a function of the variances and covariance of the individual stocks, and the proportion of money invested in each:\n\nvariance = x1^2 * var1 + x2^2 * var2 + 2 * x1 * x2 * covariance\n\nwhere var1 and var2 are the variances of stock1 and stock2 respectively, and covariance is the covariance of the returns of the two stocks.\n\nGiven Ann's aversion to risk, we want to minimize the variance of the portfolio subject to the constraints above.\n\nLet's now solve this problem using a linear optimization method.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
