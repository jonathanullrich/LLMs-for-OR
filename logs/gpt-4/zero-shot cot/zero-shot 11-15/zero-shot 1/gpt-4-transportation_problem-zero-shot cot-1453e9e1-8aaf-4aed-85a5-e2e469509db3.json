Linear programming is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the cost of the beer while meeting Tom's thirst requirements. The decision variables would be the amount of beer Tom purchases from each person on each day.\n\nLet's denote the amount of beer Tom purchases from Dick on day 1 and day 2 as x and y respectively. Similarly, the amount of beer Tom purchases from Harry on day 1 and day 2 as a and b respectively.\n\nThe problem can be expressed in the following way:\n\nMinimize: 3*x + 2.7*y + 2.9*a + 2.8*b\n\nSubject to:\n\n1) x + a = 3 (Tom's requirement for day 1)\n\n2) y + b = 4 (Tom's requirement for day 2)\n\n3) x + y <= 5 (Dick's selling limit)\n\n4) a + b <= 4 (Harry's selling limit)\n\n5) x, y, a, b >= 0\n\nWe can use python's scipy library to solve this linear programming problem.
