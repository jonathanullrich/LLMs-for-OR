{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "This is a Linear Programming problem where we are trying to maximize a linear objective function subject to some constraints. \n\nPython offers a library called `PuLP` which you can use to solve this problem. Here is an example of how you can approach this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Create a problem variable\nprob = LpProblem(\"The_Product_Mix_Problem\", LpMaximize)\n\n# LpVariable.dicts creates a dictionary of variables with a common prefix\nx1 = LpVariable(\"Product_1\", 0, None, LpInteger)\nx2 = LpVariable(\"Product_2\", 0, None, LpInteger)\nx3 = LpVariable(\"Product_3\", 0, None, LpInteger)\n\n# Objective function\nprofit1 = 15*360 + lpSum([30*(x1 - 15)]) \nprofit2 = 20*240 + 20*120 + lpSum([90*(x2 - 40)]) \nprofit3 = 20*450 + 10*300 + lpSum([180*(x3 - 30)]) \nprob += profit1 + profit2 + profit3\n\n# Constraints\nprob += x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\nprob += 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200\nprob += x1 + 2*x3 <= 70\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\nsolution = (value(x1), value(x2), value(x3))\n```\nPlease note that above code won't run as it is. This is just a direction of how you can form your problem statement to solve it using python. \n\nAlso, remember that PuLP does not handle piecewise linear functions natively. So, you have to manually construct these functions. For example, the profit for product 1 is $360 per unit for the first 15 units and $30 for each additional unit. This is represented in the code as `15*360 + lpSum([30*(x1 - 15)])`. \n\nThe `lpSum([30*(x1 - 15)])` part calculates the profit for any units of product 1 produced beyond the first 15. If fewer than 15 units are produced, this part of the function contributes zero to the total profit.", "code": "from pulp import *\n\n# Create a problem variable\nprob = LpProblem(\"The_Product_Mix_Problem\", LpMaximize)\n\n# LpVariable.dicts creates a dictionary of variables with a common prefix\nx1 = LpVariable(\"Product_1\", 0, None, LpInteger)\nx2 = LpVariable(\"Product_2\", 0, None, LpInteger)\nx3 = LpVariable(\"Product_3\", 0, None, LpInteger)\n\n# Objective function\nprofit1 = 15*360 + lpSum([30*(x1 - 15)]) \nprofit2 = 20*240 + 20*120 + lpSum([90*(x2 - 40)]) \nprofit3 = 20*450 + 10*300 + lpSum([180*(x3 - 30)]) \nprob += profit1 + profit2 + profit3\n\n# Constraints\nprob += x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60\nprob += 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200\nprob += x1 + 2*x3 <= 70\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\nsolution = (value(x1), value(x2), value(x3))", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
