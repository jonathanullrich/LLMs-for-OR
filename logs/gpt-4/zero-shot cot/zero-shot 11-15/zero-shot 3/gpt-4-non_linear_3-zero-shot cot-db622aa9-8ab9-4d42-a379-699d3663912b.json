Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "The problem can be modeled as a Quadratic Programming problem. The goal is to minimize the risk (variance) subject to the constraint that the portfolio return should be at least 15% of the total investment.\n\nThe decision variables for this problem are the number of blocks of stock 1 (x) and stock 2 (y) to buy.\n\nThe objective function to be minimized is the variance, which is given by: 4x\u00b2 + 100y\u00b2 + 2*5xy = 4x\u00b2 + 100y\u00b2 + 10xy. This represents the total risk of the portfolio.\n\nThe constraints for the problem are:\n\n1. The total investment should be equal to $50,000. Since each block of stock 1 costs $20,000 and each block of stock 2 costs $30,000, this constraint can be written as: 20x + 30y = 50.\n\n2. The expected return should be at least 15% of the total investment. Since each block of stock 1 has a return of $5,000 and each block of stock 2 has a return of $10,000, this constraint can be written as: 5x + 10y >= 15% * 50.\n\nWe can use the CVXPY library in Python to solve this Quadratic Programming problem. Let's write the code for this.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
