The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "First, consider the individual costs for each week if Luxor Travel were to rent exactly the number of cars they need for each week. This cost includes both the rental fee per car and the transaction fee:\n\n- Week 1: (7 cars * $220/car) + $500 = $2040\n- Week 2: (4 cars * $220/car) + $500 = $1380\n- Week 3: (7 cars * $220/car) + $500 = $2040\n- Week 4: (8 cars * $220/car) + $500 = $2260\n\nIf we sum up these costs, the total cost for Luxor Travel to rent exactly the number of cars they need each week is $2040 + $1380 + $2040 + $2260 = $7720.\n\nNow, let's consider the cost if Luxor Travel were to rent the maximum number of cars they need for any given week (8 cars), and keep those cars for all four weeks. The cost for this scenario includes the rental fee per car for all four weeks, and a single transaction fee:\n\n- (8 cars * $220/car * 4 weeks) + $500 = $14280\n\nClearly, the first scenario (renting exactly the number of cars needed each week) is cheaper. However, we can still optimize the costs. For example, Luxor Travel could rent 7 cars in the first week, keep them for the second week (since they need 4 cars, which is less than 7), and then rent one more car for the third and fourth weeks (since they need 7 and 8 cars, respectively). This would bring the cost down to:\n\n- Week 1 and 2: (7 cars * $220/car * 2 weeks) + $500 = $3870\n- Week 3 and 4: (1 car * $220/car * 2 weeks) + $500 = $940\n\nThe total cost for this scenario is $3870 + $940 = $4810, which is the minimal cost. Therefore, the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand is to rent 7 cars in the first week, keep them for the second week, and then rent one more car for the third and fourth weeks.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
