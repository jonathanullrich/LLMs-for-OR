The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": "First, let's start with the job that has the earliest deadline, which is Job 2. It takes 4 days to complete, and needs to be completed by the end of day 4, so we should start it first. After 4 days, we have completed Job 2.\n\nNext, we should look at the remaining jobs. Job 1 takes 6 days and needs to be completed by the end of day 8. However, we've already spent 4 days on Job 2, so we won't be able to meet this deadline. \n\nSo we move on to the next job with the earliest deadline, which is Job 1. It needs to be completed by the end of day 8 and takes 6 days, but we've already used up 4 days, so we have two days left. We can't start Job 1 yet, because it won't be completed in time.\n\nNext, we look at Job 3, which needs to be completed by day 12 and takes 5 days. We've already used up 4 days, so we can start Job 3 and it will be completed by day 9.\n\nFinally, we have Job 4, which needs to be completed by day 16 and takes 8 days. We've used up 9 days so far, so we can start Job 4 and it will be completed by day 17.\n\nSo, the minimal time to process the jobs is 17 days.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
