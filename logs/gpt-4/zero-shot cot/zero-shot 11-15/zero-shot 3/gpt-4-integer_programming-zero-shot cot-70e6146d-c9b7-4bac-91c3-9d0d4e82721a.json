{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. There are four tasks: Marketing, Cooking, Dishwashing, and Laundry.\n2. Each person must perform two tasks.\n3. We need to assign the tasks in such a way that the total time taken is the least.\n\nTo solve this, we can compare the time taken by each person for each task and assign the task to the person who can do it in less time. Let's assign tasks accordingly:\n\n1. Marketing: Eve takes less time than Steven, so assign this to Eve.\n2. Cooking: Steven takes less time than Eve, so assign this to Steven.\n3. Dishwashing: Eve takes less time than Steven, so assign this to Eve.\n4. Laundry: Eve takes less time than Steven, but she already has two tasks assigned. We have to assign this to Steven.\n\nNow, let's add up the time taken by each person for their assigned tasks. The result will be the minimum total time spent on chores. \n\nLet's proceed with the Python code to calculate the total time.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
