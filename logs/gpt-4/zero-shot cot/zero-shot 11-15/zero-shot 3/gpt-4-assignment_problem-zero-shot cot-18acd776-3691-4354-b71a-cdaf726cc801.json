Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "Yes, first we need to convert the given data into a format that can be used for computation. We can use a dictionary to store the data, where the key will be the swimmer's name and the value will be a list of their best times in the order of Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly, Freestyle. The data would look like this:\n\nswimmers = {\n    \"Carl\": [37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],\n    \"Chris\": [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],\n    \"David\": [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],\n    \"Tony\": [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],\n    \"Ken\": [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]\n}\n\nNext, we need to find all possible combinations of four swimmers and all possible permutations of strokes for each combination. We can use the itertools library in Python for this.\n\nFinally, we loop through each combination and permutation, calculate the total time, and update the minimum time and corresponding assignment if the calculated time is less than the current minimum time.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
