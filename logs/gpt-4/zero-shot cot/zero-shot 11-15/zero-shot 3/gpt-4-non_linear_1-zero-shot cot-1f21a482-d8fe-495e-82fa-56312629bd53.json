Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break this problem down:\n\n1. The demand function is given by f = 53 - 100*(t/100) = 53 - t. This means that for each 1% increase in the tax rate, the average daily consumption per smoker decreases by 1 cigarette.\n2. The tax revenue is given by the tax rate (t) times the average daily consumption per smoker times the base price per cigarette (0.15). Therefore, the tax revenue function is given by R = t * f * 0.15 = t * (53 - t) * 0.15.\n3. To find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we need to find the maximum point of this function. This is a quadratic function, and its maximum point occurs at the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function given by y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b/2a.\n4. In this case, a = -0.15, b = 53 * 0.15 = 7.95, and c = 0. So the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is given by -b/2a = -7.95 / (2*-0.15) = 26.5.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
