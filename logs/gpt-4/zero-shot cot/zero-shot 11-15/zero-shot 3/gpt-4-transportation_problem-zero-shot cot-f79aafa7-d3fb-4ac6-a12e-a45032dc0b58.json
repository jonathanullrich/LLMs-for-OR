Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": "First, Tom could buy the maximum amount of pints that Dick is willing to sell today, which is 5 pints. This would mean that he would spend $3.00 * 5 = $15.00. However, he still needs 2 more pints to fulfill his requirement for today and tomorrow.\n\nNext, he could buy the remaining 2 pints from Harry today for $2.90 * 2 = $5.80. Now, he has fulfilled his requirement for today, but he still needs 4 pints for tomorrow.\n\nThen, he could buy the remaining 2 pints that Harry is willing to sell tomorrow, which would cost him $2.80 * 2 = $5.60. However, he still needs 2 more pints to fulfill his requirement for tomorrow.\n\nFinally, he could buy the remaining 2 pints that Dick is willing to sell tomorrow for $2.70 * 2 = $5.40. Now, he has fulfilled his requirement for both today and tomorrow.\n\nSo, Tom should buy 5 pints from Dick today, 2 pints from Harry today, 2 pints from Harry tomorrow, and 2 pints from Dick tomorrow. This would cost him $15.00 + $5.80 + $5.60 + $5.40 = $31.80 in total. So, the solution would be $31.80.\n\nLet's write a Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```Python\n# Define the cost of each pint from each person\ncost_dick_today = 3.00\ncost_dick_tomorrow = 2.70\ncost_harry_today = 2.90\ncost_harry_tomorrow = 2.80\n\n# Define the amount of pints Tom needs to buy\npints_needed_today = 3\npints_needed_tomorrow = 4\n\n# Calculate the cost for today\ncost_today = min(pints_needed_today, 5) * cost_dick_today + max(0, pints_needed_today - 5) * cost_harry_today\n\n# Calculate the cost for tomorrow\ncost_tomorrow = min(pints_needed_tomorrow, 4) * cost_harry_tomorrow + max(0, pints_needed_tomorrow - 4) * cost_dick_tomorrow\n\n# Add up the cost for today and tomorrow\nsolution = cost_today + cost_tomorrow\n```\nPlease note that this solution assumes that Tom can only buy from one person at a time, and that he will buy from the person who offers the cheapest price first. If this is not the case, the solution may be different.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
