{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to define the problem as a linear programming problem. To do so, we define our variables, constraints, and objective function.\n\nLet x1 and x2 be the number of units of product 1 and product 2, respectively, that the company produces. \n\nThe constraints of the problem are as follows:\n- For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame part and 2 units of electrical component are required. So, x1 + 3x2 <= 200 (frame parts constraint) and 2x1 + 2x2 <= 300 (electrical components constraint).\n- The company can produce no more than 60 units of product 2. So, x2 <= 60.\n- The number of units of each product that the company produces has to be non-negative. So, x1, x2 >= 0.\n\nThe objective function is the profit that the company wants to maximize. For each unit of product 1, the company makes a profit of $1, and for each unit of product 2, the company makes a profit of $2. So, the objective function is 1x1 + 2x2.\n\nWe can use the pulp library in Python to solve this linear programming problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
