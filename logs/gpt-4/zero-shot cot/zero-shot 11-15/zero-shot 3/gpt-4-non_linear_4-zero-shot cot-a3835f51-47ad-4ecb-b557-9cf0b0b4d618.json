Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we need to know that this problem is a quadratic programming problem. To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit given by the sum of the profits from both products, subject to the constraint that the total production rate cannot exceed two units per hour.\n\nThe profit function for product 1 is given by P1 = 200*R1 - 100*R1\u00b2 and for product 2 is given by P2 = 300*R2 - 100*R2\u00b2. We want to maximize the total profit P = P1 + P2.\n\nThe constraint is that the total production rate R = R1 + R2 cannot exceed two units per hour. \n\nSo, we have to maximize P = (200*R1 - 100*R1\u00b2) + (300*R2 - 100*R2\u00b2) subject to R1 + R2 <= 2 and R1, R2 >= 0.\n\nLet's solve this problem! Let's create a function that returns the negative of the profit function (since we want to maximize the profit, but Python's optimization functions can only minimize a function), and then we'll use the scipy.optimize.minimize function to find the production rates that minimize the negative profit. \n\nHere is the code for it:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef neg_profit(R):\n    R1, R2 = R\n    return -((200*R1 - 100*R1**2) + (300*R2 - 100*R2**2))\n\ncons = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda R:  2 - sum(R)},\n        {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda R:  R})\n\ninitial_guess = [1, 1]\nresult = minimize(neg_profit, initial_guess, constraints=cons)\n\nsolution = -result.fun\n```\n\nThe variable 'solution' will hold the maximum possible profit per hour.", "code": "from scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef neg_profit(R):\n    R1, R2 = R\n    return -((200*R1 - 100*R1**2) + (300*R2 - 100*R2**2))\n\ncons = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda R:  2 - sum(R)},\n        {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda R:  R})\n\ninitial_guess = [1, 1]\nresult = minimize(neg_profit, initial_guess, constraints=cons)\n\nsolution = -result.fun", "solution": 312.4999999976299}
