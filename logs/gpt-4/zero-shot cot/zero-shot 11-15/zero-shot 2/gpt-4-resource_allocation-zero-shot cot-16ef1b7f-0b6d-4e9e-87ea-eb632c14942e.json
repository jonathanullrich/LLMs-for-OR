Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "The first step is to identify the cost associated with renting cars for each week separately. This includes the cost of renting the necessary number of cars plus the flat transaction fee. \n\nFor the first week, Luxor needs 7 cars. At a rate of $220 per car, this comes out to $1540. With the transaction fee, the total cost for the first week is $2040.\n\nFor the second week, Luxor needs 4 cars. This comes out to $880 for the cars, plus the transaction fee for a total of $1380.\n\nFor the third week, Luxor needs 7 cars again. This is another $2040.\n\nFor the fourth week, Luxor needs 8 cars at a cost of $1760 for the cars plus the transaction fee for a total of $2260.\n\nIf Luxor rents cars for each week separately, the total cost would be $2040 + $1380 + $2040 + $2260 = $7720.\n\nNow let's consider the cost if Luxor keeps some of the rentals for an additional week.\n\nFor the first week, Luxor still needs to rent 7 cars for a total of $2040.\n\nFor the second week, Luxor could keep the 4 cars they need from the first week and return the rest. This would cost $880 for the rent, but they wouldn't need to pay the transaction fee, so the total cost for the second week would be $880.\n\nFor the third week, Luxor could keep the 7 cars they need from the first week and return the rest. This would cost $1540 for the rent, but they wouldn't need to pay the transaction fee, so the total cost for the third week would be $1540.\n\nFor the fourth week, Luxor could keep the 8 cars they need from the third week and rent one additional car. This would cost $1760 for the rent, plus the transaction fee for the extra car, for a total cost of $2760 for the fourth week.\n\nIf Luxor keeps some of the rentals for an additional week, the total cost would be $2040 + $880 + $1540 + $2760 = $7220.\n\nSo, the best way for Luxor to handle the rental situation is to rent 7 cars in the first week, keep 4 of those cars for the second week, keep 7 of those cars for the third week, and keep 8 of those cars and rent one additional car for the fourth week. This would result in a minimal cost of $7220.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
