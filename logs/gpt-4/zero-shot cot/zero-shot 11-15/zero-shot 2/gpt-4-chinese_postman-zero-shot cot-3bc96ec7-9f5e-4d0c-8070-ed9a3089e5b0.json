He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break it down.\n\nFirstly, we need to identify that this is a classic problem in graph theory commonly known as the Chinese Postman Problem or Route Inspection Problem. The goal here is to find the shortest path that visits every edge (street, in this case) at least once.\n\nThe graph that we get from the problem is:\n\n    A\n   / \\\n  B---C\n  |   |\n  D---F\n / \\ / \\\nE---G---H\n\nwith the weights on the edges given by the lengths of the streets.\n\nSecondly, we need to observe that a Eulerian circuit (a path that visits every edge exactly once and starts and ends on the same vertex) exists if and only if every vertex has an even degree (number of edges incident on it). In our graph, vertices B, D, F, G have an odd degree.\n\nThe strategy to solve this problem is then to add duplicate edges to make the degree of every vertex even while adding the least possible total weight. \n\nWe can add duplicate edges between B-D (length 4), D-F (length 4), F-G (length 5), G-B (length 3+3+4 = 10). This would add a total weight of 4 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 23.\n\nFinally, we add this to the total weight of all edges in the original graph which is 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 38.\n\nSo, the minimum length that the Postman will have to walk is 38 + 23 = 61.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
