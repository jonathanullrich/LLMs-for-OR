Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, here are the steps we can follow:\n\n1. Identify the problem type: This is a linear programming problem where we want to minimize the time taken by the relay team. The decision variables are the assignment of swimmers to each stroke.\n\n2. Model the problem: We can create a 5x4 matrix where each row represents a swimmer and each column represents a stroke. The value in each cell is the time taken by a swimmer for a particular stroke.\n\n3. Define the constraints: Each swimmer can only swim one stroke for the relay, meaning that each row can only have one 1 and the rest 0s. Similarly, each stroke can only be swum by one swimmer, meaning each column can only have one 1 and the rest 0s.\n\n4. Define the objective function: The objective is to minimize the total time taken by the relay team, which is the sum product of the assignment matrix and the time matrix.\n\n5. Solve the problem: Use a linear programming solver to find the optimal assignment.\n\nNow, let's implement this in python.\n\nWe can use the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function to solve this problem. However, this function only supports minimization problems. Since we are trying to minimize the total time, this is acceptable.\n\nWe need to convert our problem into standard form for the solver. The standard form of a linear program is:\n\nMinimize: c^T * x\n\nSubject to: A_ub * x <= b_ub\n\nA_eq * x == b_eq\n\nwhere x >= 0\n\nHere, x is an array of decision variables, c is the coefficients of the objective function, A_ub and b_ub are the coefficients and right-hand side of the inequality constraints, and A_eq and b_eq are the coefficients and right-hand side of the equality constraints.\n\nLet's represent the assignment of swimmers to strokes as a binary variable x[i, j], where i is the swimmer and j is the stroke. If swimmer i is assigned to stroke j, x[i, j] = 1; otherwise, x[i, j] = 0.\n\nThe time taken by each swimmer for each stroke is given in the problem statement. We can represent this as a 2D array `times`.\n\nOur objective is to minimize the total time of the relay team, which is the sum of the times taken by each swimmer for their assigned stroke. We can write this as the sum of times[i, j] * x[i, j] over all i and j. In terms of the c vector and x vector, this is just c^T * x, where c is the vectorized form of the `times` array.\n\nThe constraints are that each swimmer can only swim one stroke and each stroke can only be swum by one swimmer. We can express these as:\n\nFor each i, sum of x[i, j] over all j == 1. This is equivalent to A_eq * x == b_eq, where A_eq is the identity matrix of size 5 and b_eq is a vector of ones of size 5.\n\nSimilarly, for each j, sum of x[i, j] over all i == 1. This is another set of equality constraints.\n\nFinally, since x[i, j] represents an assignment, it must be either 0 or 1. We can express this as 0 <= x[i, j] <= 1 for all i and j.\n\nNow we can put all these together and solve the linear program.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
