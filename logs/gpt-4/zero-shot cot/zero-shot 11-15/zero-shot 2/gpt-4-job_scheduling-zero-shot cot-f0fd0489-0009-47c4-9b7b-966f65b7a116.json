The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": "To find the minimal time to process the jobs, it would be best to prioritize the jobs based on their deadlines. In this case, the jobs with the earliest deadlines should be done first. \n\nThe order of the jobs would be: \nJob 2 -> Job 1 -> Job 3 -> Job 4 \n\nThe time taken to complete each job in this order would be:\nJob 2: 4 days\nJob 1: 6 days\nJob 3: 5 days\nJob 4: 8 days\n\nSo, the minimal time to process the jobs would be the sum of the time taken for each job, which is 23 days.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
