Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "First, it is useful to understand that we are dealing with a portfolio optimization problem, where we are trying to find the optimal mix of two risky assets to minimize the total risk. \n\nThe total risk of a portfolio consisting of two risky assets is calculated as: \n\n     Risk(P) = w1^2 * \u03c31^2 + w2^2 * \u03c32^2 + 2 * w1 * w2 * Cov(1,2)\n\nwhere w1 and w2 are the weights of the assets in the portfolio, \u03c31 and \u03c32 are the standard deviations of the assets, and Cov(1,2) is the covariance between the assets.\n\nSimilarly, the return of the portfolio is calculated as: \n\n     Return(P) = w1 * r1 + w2 * r2 \n\nwhere r1 and r2 are the returns of the assets.\n\nGiven the information in the problem, we can formulate the following optimization problem:\n\n     Minimize: w1^2 * 4 + w2^2 * 100 + 2 * w1 * w2 * 5\n\n     Subject to: w1 * 5 + w2 * 10 >= 15 \n                 w1 * 20 + w2 * 30 <= 50\n                 w1, w2 >= 0 \n\nThis problem can be solved using quadratic programming. However, since it is a small problem, we can also solve it using brute force. Here is a simple Python code that does that:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initialize minimum risk and corresponding weights\nmin_risk = np.inf\nopt_w1 = opt_w2 = 0\n\n# Loop through all possible combinations of weights\nfor w1 in np.arange(0, 51):  # Ann has $50,000 to invest\n    for w2 in np.arange(0, 51):\n        if w1 * 20 + w2 * 30 <= 50:  # Total investment should not exceed $50,000\n            risk = w1**2 * 4 + w2**2 * 100 + 2 * w1 * w2 * 5\n            return_ = w1 * 5 + w2 * 10\n            if risk < min_risk and return_ >= 15:  # Check if this combination has lower risk and sufficient return\n                min_risk = risk\n                opt_w1 = w1\n                opt_w2 = w2\n\n# Print optimal combination\nprint(f'Optimal investment: {opt_w1*20} in stock 1 and {opt_w2*30} in stock 2')\n```\n\nPlease note that this code does not necessarily find the global minimum, but it should give a reasonable solution. To find the global minimum, you would need to use a more sophisticated optimization algorithm, such as quadratic programming.", "code": "import numpy as np\n\n# Initialize minimum risk and corresponding weights\nmin_risk = np.inf\nopt_w1 = opt_w2 = 0\n\n# Loop through all possible combinations of weights\nfor w1 in np.arange(0, 51):  # Ann has $50,000 to invest\n    for w2 in np.arange(0, 51):\n        if w1 * 20 + w2 * 30 <= 50:  # Total investment should not exceed $50,000\n            risk = w1**2 * 4 + w2**2 * 100 + 2 * w1 * w2 * 5\n            return_ = w1 * 5 + w2 * 10\n            if risk < min_risk and return_ >= 15:  # Check if this combination has lower risk and sufficient return\n                min_risk = risk\n                opt_w1 = w1\n                opt_w2 = w2\n\n# Print optimal combination\nprint(f'Optimal investment: {opt_w1*20} in stock 1 and {opt_w2*30} in stock 2')", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
