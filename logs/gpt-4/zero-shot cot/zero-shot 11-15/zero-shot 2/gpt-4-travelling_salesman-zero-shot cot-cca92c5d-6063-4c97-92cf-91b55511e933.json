Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, here are the steps you can follow to solve this problem:\n\n1. First, we can create a bipartite graph representing employees and projects. In this graph, there would be an edge between an employee node and a project node if the employee is working on that project.\n\n2. Next, we need to find a matching in this bipartite graph that covers all the employee nodes. This matching will represent a schedule of meetings where each meeting is attended by one employee and covers all of their projects.\n\n3. However, the problem is a bit more complicated because the manager wants to minimize the traffic in and out of the meeting room. This means we need to order the meetings in such a way that as many meetings as possible are held consecutively without any employee leaving or entering the room.\n\n4. This is equivalent to finding the longest path in a graph where the nodes represent meetings and there is an edge between two nodes if the same employee attends both meetings.\n\n5. This problem is known to be NP-hard, but since the size of the problem is small (only 10 employees and 6 projects), we can solve it using a brute force approach. We can generate all possible orders of meetings and pick the one that minimizes the number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.\n\n6. To do this, we can represent each possible order of meetings as a permutation of the numbers from 1 to 10 (since there are 10 employees). We can then calculate the number of employees entering or leaving the room for each permutation and keep track of the minimum.\n\n7. Finally, the minimum number of employees entering or leaving the room is the solution to the problem. \n\nNow, let\u2019s convert these steps into code!", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
