Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to understand that the problem is about optimizing the profit from the production of two products. The total production cannot exceed two units per hour.\n\nThe rates of production for the two products are R1 and R2, and we have the profit function for each product. The goal is to find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize the total profit.\n\nThe total profit would be the sum of the profits from the two products, which is $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 + $300*R2 - $100*R2^2.\n\nSince the total production cannot exceed two units per hour, we have the constraint R1 + R2 \u2264 2. \n\nTo find the optimal solution, we can use a methodology such as calculus or optimization techniques. Since the profit functions are quadratic, we can use calculus to find the maximum. We need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to R1 and R2, set them equal to zero, and solve for R1 and R2. \n\nWe also need to check the boundary conditions (R1 = 0, R2 = 0, R1 + R2 = 2) to ensure we find the global maximum.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified explanation. In practice, you may want to use numerical optimization techniques, especially for more complex problems. Also, the solution needs to make sense in the context of the problem - for instance, the production rates R1 and R2 cannot be negative.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
