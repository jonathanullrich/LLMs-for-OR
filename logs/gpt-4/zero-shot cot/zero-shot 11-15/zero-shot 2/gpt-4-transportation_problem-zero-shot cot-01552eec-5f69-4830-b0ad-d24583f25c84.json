Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": "First, Tom needs to determine how many pints he should buy from Dick and Harry each day to meet his demand while minimizing his cost.\n\nLet's denote D1 as the pints bought from Dick on the first day, D2 as the pints bought from Dick on the second day, H1 as the pints bought from Harry on the first day, and H2 as the pints bought from Harry on the second day. \n\nWe know that:\n\n- D1 + D2 <= 5 (Dick's maximum supply)\n- H1 + H2 <= 4 (Harry's maximum supply)\n- D1 + H1 = 3 (Tom's demand on the first day)\n- D2 + H2 = 4 (Tom's demand on the second day)\n\nWe also know that Tom wants to minimize his cost, which is 3.00*D1 + 2.70*D2 + 2.90*H1 + 2.80*H2.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, and we can solve it using Python's SciPy library, specifically the `scipy.optimize.linprog` method.\n\nThis method needs the problem to be in a specific form, namely:\n\nminimize: c^T * x\n\nsubject to: A_ub * x <= b_ub\n\nIn our case:\n\n- c = [3.00, 2.70, 2.90, 2.80]\n- x = [D1, D2, H1, H2]\n- A_ub = [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]\n- b_ub = [5, 4, 3, 4]\n\nNow we can write the code:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\nc = [3.00, 2.70, 2.90, 2.80]\nA_ub = [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [-1, 0, -1, 0], [0, -1, 0, -1]]\nb_ub = [5, 4, -3, -4]\n\nresult = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, method='highs')\nsolution = result.fun\n```\n\nThe `solution` variable now contains the minimum cost for Tom.
