{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "To maximize the tax revenue, we need to find the tax rate that maximizes the product of the number of cigarettes consumed and the tax per cigarette. \n\nThe tax per cigarette is the base price times the tax rate, i.e., 0.15 * t. The number of cigarettes consumed is given by the function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). \n\nTherefore, the tax revenue R can be expressed as:\n\nR = (number of cigarettes) * (tax per cigarette)\n  = (53 - t) * (0.15*t)\n\nTo find the tax rate that maximizes R, we can take the derivative of R with respect to t, set it equal to zero, and solve for t. \n\nLet's do that now.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
