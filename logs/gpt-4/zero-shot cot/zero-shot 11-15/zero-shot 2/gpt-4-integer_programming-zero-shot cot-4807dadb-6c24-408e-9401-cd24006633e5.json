{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to identify the two tasks that Eve can perform the fastest and the two tasks that Steven can perform the fastest. \n\nFor Eve, these tasks are Dishwashing and Laundry, which take 3.6 hours and 2.9 hours respectively. This totals to 6.5 hours.\n\nFor Steven, these tasks are Marketing and Laundry, which take 4.9 hours and 3.1 hours respectively. This totals to 8 hours.\n\nHowever, we have a conflict: both Eve and Steven would be performing Laundry according to this breakdown. \n\nTo solve this conflict, we need to find the next fastest task for Steven, which is Cooking at 7.2 hours. \n\nSo, Steven will be performing Marketing and Cooking, which totals to 12.1 hours.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total time spent on chores would be the sum of the time spent by Eve and Steven, which is 6.5 hours plus 12.1 hours, equal to 18.6 hours.\n\nSo 'solution' will be 18.6 hours.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
