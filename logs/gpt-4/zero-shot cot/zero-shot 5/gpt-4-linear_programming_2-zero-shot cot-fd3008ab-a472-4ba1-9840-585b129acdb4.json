    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.",

    "output": "Sure, first you need to understand what is given and what is required in the problem. \n\nGiven: \n- Total money you can invest is $12,000.\n- Total time you can invest is 600 hours.\n- There are two ventures you can invest in.\n- For venture 1, full partnership would require $10,000 and 400 hours, and would yield a profit of $9,000.\n- For venture 2, full partnership would require $8,000 and 500 hours, and would yield a profit of $9,000.\n- You can choose any fraction of a full partnership, in which case all the amounts (money investment, time investment, and profit) would be multiplied by the same fraction.\n\nRequired:\n- Find the combination of investments in the two ventures that will give you the maximum total estimated profit.\n\nThis can be solved as a linear programming problem where the objective function is the total profit and the constraints are the total money and time you can invest.\n\nLet's denote:\n- x1 as the fraction of full partnership in venture 1\n- x2 as the fraction of full partnership in venture 2\n\nThen, we want to maximize the objective function:\n\nP = 9000*x1 + 9000*x2\n\nsubject to the constraints:\n- 10000*x1 + 8000*x2 <= 12000 (money constraint)\n- 400*x1 + 500*x2 <= 600 (time constraint)\n- x1, x2 >= 0 (you can't have a negative fraction of partnership)\n\nNow, you can use a linear programming solver to find the optimal values of x1 and x2.",
