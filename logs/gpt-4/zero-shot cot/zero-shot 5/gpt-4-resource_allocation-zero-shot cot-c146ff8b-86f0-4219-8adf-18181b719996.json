    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Sure, let's break it down.\n\n1. Luxor Travel needs 7 cars for the first week. It makes sense to rent these 7 cars for the week, which would cost $220 * 7 + $500 = $2040.\n\n2. For the second week, Luxor only needs 4 cars. They can keep 4 of the 7 cars for an additional week, costing $220 * 4 = $880. The other 3 cars can be returned, incurring no extra costs.\n\n3. For the third week, Luxor needs 7 cars again. They can keep the 4 cars for a third week, costing $220 * 4 = $880. They will need to rent 3 additional cars, costing $220 * 3 + $500 = $1160.\n\n4. For the fourth and final week, Luxor needs 8 cars. They can keep all 7 cars for another week, costing $220 * 7 = $1540. They will need to rent one additional car, costing $220 * 1 + $500 = $720.\n\nAdding up all these costs gives the minimum total cost for Luxor Travel. \n\nLet's compute this in python:\n\n```python\nweek1 = 220 * 7 + 500\nweek2 = 220 * 4\nweek3 = 220 * 4 + 220 * 3 + 500\nweek4 = 220 * 7 + 220 * 1 + 500\n\nsolution = week1 + week2 + week3 + week4\n```\n\nThis python code would give the minimum cost for Luxor Travel to meet their rental needs for the next four weeks.",
