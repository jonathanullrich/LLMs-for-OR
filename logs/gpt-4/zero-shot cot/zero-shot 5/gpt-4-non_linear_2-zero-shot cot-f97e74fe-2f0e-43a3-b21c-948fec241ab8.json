    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The optimum location is sought for an airfield from which the six airfields A to F can be approached. The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.",

    "output": "First, we need to calculate the total sum of daily flight kilometers for each field. The formula for the distance between two points in a plane is sqrt((x2-x1)\u00b2+(y2-y1)\u00b2). This needs to be multiplied by the number of flights.\n\nThen, we need to find the location that results in the minimum sum of daily flight kilometers. However, we must also consider the constraints: the location cannot be in the swamp area or the lake area.\n\nWe will need to use an optimization algorithm for this. A suitable method could be the Gradient Descent algorithm. \n\nFirst, we will define the constraints and the objective function. Then, we will run the optimization algorithm to find the minimum value of the objective function, which will give us the optimal location. However, the assistant here can't run the complex python code with multiple iterations and optimizations. \n\nHowever, it can be done using scipy.optimize library's minimize function in python on your local system. \n\nHere is the sample code for your reference:\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nfrom math import sqrt\n\n# define the coordinates and flights of each airfield\nairfields = [(40, 200, 40), (160, 210, 10), (250, 160, 20), (220, 80, 30), (100, 40, 20), (30, 100, 10)]\n\n# define the objective function\ndef objective(location):\n    x, y = location\n    total_distance = 0\n    for x1, y1, num_flights in airfields:\n        distance = sqrt((x1-x)**2 + (y1-y)**2)\n        total_distance += distance * num_flights\n    return total_distance\n\n# constraints for the swamp and the lake\nconstraints = [{'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 250 - (x[0] + x[1])},\n               {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 400 - ((x[0] - 100)**2 + (x[1] - 100)**2)}]\n\n# initial guess\nx0 = (0, 0)\n\n# run the optimization\nresult = minimize(objective, x0, constraints=constraints)\n\nsolution = result.fun\n```\nThe 'solution' variable will contain the minimum sum of daily flight kilometers for the optimal location of the airfield. Please note that the constraints are defined as inequalities, where the function value must be non-negative for the constraints to be satisfied. \n\nThis is a simplified version of the problem and the actual code might need to handle more corner cases and complexities. \n\nPlease note that you need to run this code on your local system as this assistant can't execute complex python code.",
