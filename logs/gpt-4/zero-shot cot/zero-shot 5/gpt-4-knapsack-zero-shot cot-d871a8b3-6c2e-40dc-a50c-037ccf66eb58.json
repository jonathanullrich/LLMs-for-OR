    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.",

    "output": "1. We are given three items with different volumes and values. We need to choose items in such a way that the total volume of the chosen items does not exceed the volume of the backpack, and the total value of the chosen items is maximized.\n\n2. This is a classic example of a Knapsack problem, a problem in combinatorial optimization. The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.\n\n3. Let's denote the volume of the backpack as W (in this case, W = 5), the volumes of the items as w (w = [2, 3, 4]), and the values of the items as v (v = [30, 50, 70]).\n\n4. We will create a 2D array K of size (n+1)x(W+1), where n is the number of items. K[i][j] will store the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing items from the first i items with a total volume not exceeding j.\n\n5. We will fill the array K in a bottom-up manner. For each item, we will consider all possible volumes from 0 to W, and for each volume, we will choose the maximum of two options: not including the current item (K[i-1][j]) or including the current item (v[i] + K[i-1][j-w[i]]) if j >= w[i].\n\n6. The optimal solution will be stored in K[n][W].\n\nHere is a python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef knapSack(W, wt, val, n):\n    K = [[0 for w in range(W + 1)]\n            for i in range(n + 1)]\n             \n    # Build table K[][] in bottom\n    # up manner\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        for w in range(W + 1):\n            if i == 0 or w == 0:\n                K[i][w] = 0\n            elif wt[i - 1] <= w:\n                K[i][w] = max(val[i - 1] \n                  + K[i - 1][w - wt[i - 1]],\n                               K[i - 1][w])\n            else:\n                K[i][w] = K[i - 1][w]\n \n    return K[n][W]\n     \n# Driver code\nval = [30, 50, 70]\nwt = [2, 3, 4]\nW = 5\nn = len(val)\nsolution = knapSack(W, wt, val, n)\n```\n\nThis code will return the optimal solution, which is the maximum total value of items that the hiker can take with him.",
