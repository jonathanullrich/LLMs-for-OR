    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",

    "output": "First, we need to express Ann's problem mathematically. Let's denote the number of blocks of stock 1 and stock 2 Ann is going to buy by x1 and x2 respectively. \n\nAnn's goal is to minimize her investment x1*20*1000 + x2*30*1000 under the constraints:\n\n1) that her expected return is at least 15 percent, i.e. 0.15*(x1*20*1000 + x2*30*1000) <= x1*5*1000 + x2*10*1000,\n\n2) that she does not exceed her budget of $50,000, i.e. x1*20*1000 + x2*30*1000 <= $50,000.\n\nNote that we have multiplied the price and return per block by 1000 because Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, which can be solved using Python's scipy.optimize.linprog function.",
