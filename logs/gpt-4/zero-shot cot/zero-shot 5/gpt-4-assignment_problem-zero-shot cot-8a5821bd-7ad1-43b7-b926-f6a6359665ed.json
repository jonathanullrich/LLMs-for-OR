Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, here's how you can approach this problem:\n\n1. The first step is to create a dictionary with the swimmers as keys and their times for each stroke as values. \n\n2. You then need to create a list of all possible combinations of four swimmers. \n\n3. For each combination, calculate the total time by adding the best time for each stroke.\n\n4. Keep track of the combination with the minimum total time.\n\n5. The minimum time spent is the total time for this combination. \n\nFor this, you can use the `itertools` library in Python which provides a function `combinations` to generate all possible combinations. You can use a for loop to iterate over all combinations and calculate the total time. \n\nBut this is a challenging coding problem and it's important to note that it can be solved using operations research (OR) techniques, such as linear programming. \n\nIn a linear programming problem, we are given a linear function to minimize (in this case the total time) subject to a set of linear constraints (in this case that each swimmer can only swim one stroke).\n\nThere are various libraries available in Python to solve linear programming problems, such as `pulp` or `scipy.optimize.linprog`. \n\nHowever, this problem is actually a special case of linear programming known as an \"assignment problem\", which can be solved more efficiently using the Hungarian algorithm. The `scipy.optimize` module provides a function `linear_sum_assignment` which solves assignment problems. \n\nWe can create a cost matrix where each row represents a swimmer and each column represents a stroke. The value at each cell is the time the swimmer takes to swim the stroke. \n\nThen we can use the `linear_sum_assignment` function to find the assignment of swimmers to strokes that minimizes the total time. \n\nHere is how you can do it: \n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# create the cost matrix\ncost = np.array([[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n                 [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n                 [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n                 [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n                 [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]) # Ken\n\n# use the linear_sum_assignment function to find the optimal assignment\nrow_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)\n\n# calculate the minimum time\nsolution = cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()\n```\n\nIn this code, `row_ind` and `col_ind` are arrays of indices that give the optimal assignment of swimmers to strokes. `solution` is the minimum total time.", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\n# create the cost matrix\ncost = np.array([[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n                 [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n                 [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n                 [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n                 [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]) # Ken\n\n# use the linear_sum_assignment function to find the optimal assignment\nrow_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost)\n\n# calculate the minimum time\nsolution = cost[row_ind, col_ind].sum()", "solution": 126.2}
