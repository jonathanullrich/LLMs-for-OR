    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "The first step is to find out how many pints Tom can buy from Dick and Harry each day. \n\nOn the first day, Tom wants to buy 3 pints. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints in total, so he can sell Tom 3 pints on the first day. Harry, on the other hand, is only willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints in total, so he can only sell Tom 1 pint on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, Tom wants to buy 4 pints. Dick, having sold 3 pints on the first day, can only sell Tom 2 pints on the second day. Harry, having sold 1 pint on the first day, can sell Tom 3 pints on the second day.\n\nThe second step is to calculate the cost for each scenario. \n\nIf Tom buys 3 pints from Dick and 1 pint from Harry on the first day, it will cost him $3.00*3+$2.90*1=$11.90. On the second day, if Tom buys 2 pints from Dick and 3 pints from Harry, it will cost him $2.70*2+$2.80*3=$13.60. The total cost for this scenario is $11.90+$13.60=$25.50.\n\nHowever, if Tom buys 2 pints from Dick and 3 pints from Harry on the first day, it will cost him $3.00*2+$2.90*3=$13.70. On the second day, if Tom buys 3 pints from Dick and 1 pint from Harry, it will cost him $2.70*3+$2.80*1=$10.90. The total cost for this scenario is $13.70+$10.90=$24.60.\n\nSo, the best solution for Tom to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements is to buy 2 pints from Dick and 1 pint from Harry on the first day, and then buy 3 pints from Dick and 1 pint from Harry on the second day. The total cost will be $24.60.\n\nLet's write the Python code to calculate this.",
