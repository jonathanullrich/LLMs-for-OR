    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",

    "output": "First, we need to understand the problem. It's about minimizing the number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room. \n\nIf we look at the problem, we can see that it's a graph problem where employees are nodes and projects are edges. \n\nTo minimize the total traffic, we need to find an optimal order of meetings such that the total number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room is minimized.\n\nHere, we can think of a greedy algorithm:\n\n1. Start with the employee who has the most projects.\n2. Add the next employee who shares the most projects with the current group of employees.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all employees are in the meeting room.\n4. Count the total number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.\n\nThis problem can be solved using Python. Let's write a Python program to solve this problem.\n\n```python\ndef find_min_traffic(projects):\n    employees = list(range(1, 11))\n    meetings = []\n    while employees:\n        # find employee with most projects\n        most_projects = max(projects, key=lambda x: len(projects[x]))\n        meetings.append(most_projects)\n        employees.remove(most_projects)\n        # remove projects that are already covered\n        for proj in projects[most_projects]:\n            for emp in employees:\n                if proj in projects[emp]:\n                    projects[emp].remove(proj)\n        # remove employee from project list\n        del projects[most_projects]\n    # calculate total traffic\n    total_traffic = sum(len(meetings[i:i+2]) - len(set(meetings[i:i+2])) for i in range(len(meetings)-1))\n    return total_traffic\n\nprojects = {\n    1: [2, 4, 5],\n    2: [1, 3, 5],\n    3: [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    4: [3, 4, 5],\n    5: [1, 2, 3],\n    6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\n    7: [1, 2, 5, 6],\n    8: [1, 3, 4],\n    9: [5, 6],\n    10: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6],\n}\n\nsolution = find_min_traffic(projects)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis Python program first creates a list of employees and an empty list of meetings. It then enters a loop where it finds the employee with the most projects, adds them to the meetings list, removes them from the employees list, and removes any projects that are already covered by the current group of employees. This continues until all employees have been added to the meetings list. The program then calculates the total traffic by finding the number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room for each pair of consecutive meetings and adds these numbers together.\n\nPlease note that this code is a simple illustration and may not give the optimal solution. In real-world scenarios, we might need more complex algorithms or even integer programming to solve this kind of problem.",
