    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to import the required libraries. We will use the scipy and numpy libraries for this problem.\n\nNext, we need to define the objective function. The objective function represents the total profit, which is a function of x1, x2, and x3. We need to maximize this function.\n\nThe constraints are the limitations on the use of resources. We have three constraints, which are represented as inequalities. We will use the scipy.optimize.linprog function, which minimizes a linear objective function and is subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.\n\nThe scipy.optimize.linprog function requires the objective function to be in the form of a minimization problem. However, our problem is a maximization problem. Therefore, we need to convert our maximization problem into a minimization problem. We can do this by multiplying the objective function by -1.\n\nThe constraints can be represented in matrix form. The left-hand side of the constraints can be represented as a 2D array, and the right-hand side can be represented as a 1D array.\n\nFinally, we call the scipy.optimize.linprog function with the objective function, the constraints, and the bounds for the decision variables. The bounds for the decision variables represent the minimum and maximum amount of each product that can be produced.\n\nThe scipy.optimize.linprog function returns an object that contains information about the solution. We are interested in the x attribute of this object, which gives the values of the decision variables that minimize the objective function.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Define the objective function\nc = [-360, -240, -450]\n\n# Define the constraints\nA = [[1, 1, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2]]\nb = [60, 200, 70]\n\n# Define the bounds for the decision variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, None)\nx2_bounds = (0, None)\n\n# Solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds, x2_bounds])\n\n# Print the optimal solution\nsolution = res.x\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the optimal quantities of each product to maximize profit, given the constraints.",
