He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": "First of all, we should note that this is a variant of the Chinese Postman Problem, also known as the Route Inspection Problem, which is a classic problem in graph theory.\n\nThe first step is to identify which nodes are odd (have an odd number of edges connected to them) because in a graph where each node has an even number of edges, we can always find a route that starts and ends at the same point and visits each edge exactly once. This property is what makes the Chinese Postman Problem solvable.\n\nLooking at the graph given by the problem, nodes B, D, E, F, G, and H all have an odd number of edges. This means we need to duplicate some edges in order to make all nodes have an even number of edges.\n\nNext, we need to figure out which edges to duplicate. We want to minimize the total length of the route, so we should duplicate the shortest possible edges.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\nDuplicate the edges B-D (length 4), B-C (length 3), D-F (length 4), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3), and E-F (length 9).\n\nThis gives us a total length of 2 (A-B) + 2 (A-C) + 3 (B-C) * 2 + 4 (B-D) * 2 + 3 (D-E) + 4 (D-F) * 2 + 9 (E-F) * 2 + 3 (E-G) + 5 (F-G) * 2 + 3 (G-H) * 2 = 70.\n\nThe Postman's route could be: A-B, B-D, D-F, F-G, G-H, H-G, G-F, F-D, D-B, B-C, C-A, A-C, C-B, B-D, D-E, E-F, F-E, E-G.\n\nNote: There might be other solutions with the same minimal length since the problem does not specify unique solutions.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
