{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to make a list of all possible combinations of tasks for Eve and Steven. Since each person has to perform two tasks, this means we have to choose two tasks out of four for one person, and the remaining two tasks will be assigned to the other person. There are six combinations in total: \n\n1. Eve: Marketing & Cooking, Steven: Dishwashing & Laundry\n2. Eve: Marketing & Dishwashing, Steven: Cooking & Laundry\n3. Eve: Marketing & Laundry, Steven: Cooking & Dishwashing\n4. Eve: Cooking & Dishwashing, Steven: Marketing & Laundry\n5. Eve: Cooking & Laundry, Steven: Marketing & Dishwashing\n6. Eve: Dishwashing & Laundry, Steven: Marketing & Cooking\n\nNext, we will calculate the total time for each combination and choose the one with the minimum time. This is a straightforward calculation based on the given times for each task and person. Let's write the Python code for this.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
