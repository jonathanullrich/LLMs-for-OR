    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.",

    "output": "Sure, the problem can be solved using linear programming. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Define the problem: The problem is to maximize the total profit subject to the given constraints.\n\n2. Define the decision variables: x1, x2, x3 are the decision variables, representing the number of units of product 1, product 2, and product 3 to be produced, respectively.\n\n3. Define the objective function: The objective function is a linear function of the decision variables, representing the total profit. The profit function changes depending on the quantity of each product, so it's a piecewise linear function.\n\n4. Define the constraints: The constraints are linear inequalities that limit the values of the decision variables.\n\n5. Solve the linear programming problem: Use a linear programming solver to find the values of the decision variables that maximize the objective function subject to the constraints.\n\nHere is how to implement this in python using the scipy.optimize.linprog function:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients in the objective function\nc = [-360, -240, -450]\n\n# Coefficients in the inequality constraints\nA = [[1, 1, 1], [3, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2]]\n\n# Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\nb = [60, 200, 70]\n\n# Bounds for each variable\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, None)\nx2_bounds = (0, None)\n\n# Solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds, x2_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = (res.fun, res.x)\n```\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the profit for each product is constant for any quantity. In reality, the profit function for each product is piecewise linear, which makes the problem a piecewise linear programming problem. This requires a more advanced solver.\n\nThe 'solution' variable will contain the maximum profit and the quantities of each product to produce to achieve this profit.\n\nPlease note that the linprog function minimizes the objective function, so the coefficients in the objective function are made negative to convert the problem to a minimization problem.",
