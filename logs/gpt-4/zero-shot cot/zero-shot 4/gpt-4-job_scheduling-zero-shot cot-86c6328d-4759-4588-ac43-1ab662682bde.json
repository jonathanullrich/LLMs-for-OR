    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Firstly, we need to understand that if there's only one machine to process all jobs, then the jobs must be processed one after another, not simultaneously. \n\nThe minimum time to process all jobs is simply the sum of the processing times of all jobs, which is 6 days + 4 days + 5 days + 8 days = 23 days.\n\nHowever, we also have deadlines for each job. If we just start processing the jobs in the order of 1, 2, 3, 4, we will find that job 2 cannot be completed by the end of day 4, because job 1 alone will take 6 days. \n\nSo, we need to consider the deadlines as well while deciding the order of jobs. The strategy here would be to always process the job with the earliest deadline. \n\nLet's try this approach:\n\n1. On day 0, we start with job 2 (4 days, deadline day 4). It will be completed by the end of day 4.\n\n2. Then we proceed to job 1 (6 days, deadline day 8). But it's impossible to complete it by day 8, because we will only start it on day 5. \n\nSo, it's clear that no matter what order we choose, we can't meet all the deadlines. \n\nHowever, the problem asks for the minimal time to process all jobs, not necessarily meeting the deadlines. This minimal time is, as calculated above, 23 days.",
