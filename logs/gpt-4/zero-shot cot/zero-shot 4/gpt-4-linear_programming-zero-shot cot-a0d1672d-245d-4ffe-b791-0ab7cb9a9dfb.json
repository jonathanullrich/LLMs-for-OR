    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to understand that this problem is a linear programming problem where we aim to maximize our profit based on the given constraints. \n\nWe can formulate this problem as follows:\n\nLet's denote x as the number of units of product 1 and y as the number of units of product 2. \n\nObjective function: Maximize P = x + 2y \n\nSubject to: \n\nx + 3y <= 200 (The constraint for frame parts)\n2x + 2y <= 300 (The constraint for electrical components)\ny <= 60 (The constraint for maximum units of product 2 that brings profit)\n\nAlso, x >= 0, y >= 0 because the number of units cannot be negative.\n\nNow, we can use a python library, scipy, and its linear programming function to solve this problem. The linear programming function will take the coefficients of the objective function and constraints as input and give the optimum values of x and y to maximize the profit.",
