    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Firstly, we know that the average daily consumption per smoker is given by the function f(t) = 53 - 100*(t/100). This means that as the tax rate t increases, the consumption decreases linearly.\n\nSecondly, we know that the total tax revenue is given by the product of the tax rate, the base price per cigarette, and the number of cigarettes consumed per day. So the tax revenue R(t) is given by the function R(t) = t * 0.15 * f(t).\n\nWe want to find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. This requires finding the maximum of the function R(t). We can do this by taking the derivative of R(t) with respect to t, setting it equal to zero, and solving for t.\n\nLet's write the python code to do this.",
