    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Sure. Given the problem, we see that Luxor Travel needs to minimize the cost of renting cars while meeting the demand for the next 4 weeks. \n\nThey have two options: \n\n1. Rent the exact number of cars they need each week, which would incur a $500 transaction fee each week.\n2. Rent the maximum number of cars they need in the 4 weeks at once, and pay the rental fee for each car for the weeks they are not being used. \n\nTo decide which option is best, we'll need to calculate the total cost for each and compare them. \n\nLet's start with option 1. \n\n1. Week 1: (7 cars * $220) + $500 = $2040\n2. Week 2: (4 cars * $220) + $500 = $1380\n3. Week 3: (7 cars * $220) + $500 = $2040\n4. Week 4: (8 cars * $220) + $500 = $2260\n\nThe total cost for option 1 is $2040 + $1380 + $2040 + $2260 = $7720\n\nNow let's calculate for option 2.\n\nHere, we'll rent the maximum number of cars needed, which is 8, and keep them for all 4 weeks.\n\n1. Week 1: (8 cars * $220) + $500 = $2260\n2. Week 2: (8 cars * $220) = $1760\n3. Week 3: (8 cars * $220) = $1760\n4. Week 4: (8 cars * $220) = $1760\n\nThe total cost for option 2 is $2260 + $1760 + $1760 + $1760 = $7540\n\nComparing both options, it is clear that option 2 is the cheaper option. Therefore, Luxor Travel should rent the maximum number of cars they need for the 4 weeks at once, which would cost them $7540. This is the minimal cost.",
