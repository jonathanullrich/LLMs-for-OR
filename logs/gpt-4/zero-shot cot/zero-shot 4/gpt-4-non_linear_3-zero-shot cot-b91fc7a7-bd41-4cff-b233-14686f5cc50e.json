    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Alright. First, let's denote the number of blocks for stock 1 and stock 2 as x1 and x2 respectively. We know that the total cost should be less than or equal to 50, meaning that 20*x1 + 30*x2 <= 50.\n\nSecond, we need to ensure that the expected return is at least 15%. This means that 5*x1 + 10*x2 >= 15.\n\nThird, we need to minimize the risk. The risk is expressed as the variance of the portfolio, which is x1^2 * 4 + x2^2 * 100 + 2*x1*x2*5.\n\nNow we can set up a quadratic programming problem where we minimize the variance subject to the constraints above. Quadratic programming problems can be solved using various methods, but we'll use a basic solver in Python for simplicity.\n\nThe python code might look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# function to minimize\ndef objective(x):\n    x1, x2 = x\n    return 4*x1**2 + 100*x2**2 + 2*5*x1*x2\n\n# constraints\ncons = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x:  50 - (20*x[0] + 30*x[1])},\n        {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x:  5*x[0] + 10*x[1] - 15})\n\n# initial guess\nx0 = [0, 0]\n\n# solve the problem\nsol = minimize(objective, x0, constraints=cons)\n\n# the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent is \n# the cost of buying the stocks in the optimal solution\nsolution = 20*sol.x[0] + 30*sol.x[1]\n```\n\nThis code will return the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",
