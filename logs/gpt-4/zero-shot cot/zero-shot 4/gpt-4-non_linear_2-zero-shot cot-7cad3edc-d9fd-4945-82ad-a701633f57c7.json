    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The optimum location is sought for an airfield from which the six airfields A to F can be approached. The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.",

    "output": "Sure. To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the decision variables, constraints and objective function.\n2. Formulate the problem as a linear programming problem.\n3. Solve it using a suitable method or a solver.\n\nFor this problem:\n\n- The decision variables are the coordinates of the airfield (x, y).\n- The objective function is to minimize the sum of the daily flight kilometers, which is the sum of the distances from the airfield to each of the six airfields times the number of flights.\n- The constraints are the conditions that the airfield should not be in the swamp area or the lake.\n\nWe can use a method like the simplex method or a solver like scipy.optimize.linprog to solve the problem. \n\nNow, let's write code to solve the problem. \n\nNote: In the real world, this problem would likely be non-linear due to the distance calculation and would require a non-linear solver. Here, for demonstration purposes, we will assume that the distances can be approximated as linear.",
