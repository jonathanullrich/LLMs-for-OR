Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to formulate this problem. We can use the Hungarian Algorithm, which is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time.\n\nLet's denote:\n- B as Backstroke\n- Br as Breaststroke\n- Bu as Butterfly\n- F as Freestyle\n\nLet's denote:\n- C as Carl\n- Cr as Chris\n- D as David\n- T as Tony\n- K as Ken\n\nWe create a matrix where rows represent swimmers and columns represent strokes. Each cell in the matrix represents the time of a swimmer performing a stroke.\n\n|   | B  | Br | Bu | F  |\n|---|----|----|----|----|\n| C |37.7|43.4|33.3|29.2|\n| Cr|32.9|33.1|28.5|26.4|\n| D |33.8|42.2|38.9|29.6|\n| T |37.0|34.7|30.4|28.5|\n| K |35.4|41.8|33.6|31.1|\n\nThe goal is to find a combination of 4 swimmers and 4 strokes such that each swimmer performs a different stroke and the total time is minimum.\n\nIn Python, we can use the scipy library's linear_sum_assignment function, which implements the Hungarian Algorithm, to solve this problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
