    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",

    "output": "Sure, we can use the concept of assignment problem here. The problem can be solved using the Hungarian Method algorithm.\n\n1. The first step is to form a cost matrix where each element represents the time taken by a person to perform a particular task. In this case, the matrix will be a 2x4 matrix as there are 2 people (Eve and Steven) and 4 tasks (Marketing, Cooking, Dishwashing, and Laundry).\n\n2. The second step is to reduce the matrix i.e., subtract the smallest element in each row from all the elements of that row. Then, subtract the smallest element in each column from all the elements of that column.\n\n3. The third step is to draw lines to cover all the zeros in the matrix. If the minimum number of lines drawn cover all the zeros, then that is the optimal assignment.\n\n4. If the minimum number of lines drawn do not cover all the zeros, then find the smallest element not covered by the lines, subtract it from the uncovered elements and add it to the elements covered by lines. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until an optimal assignment is found.\n\n5. Finally, each person is assigned the task that corresponds to the 0 in their row that is not covered by any other 0 in its column. This will ensure that the total time is minimized.\n\nLet's write the python code for the above steps.",
