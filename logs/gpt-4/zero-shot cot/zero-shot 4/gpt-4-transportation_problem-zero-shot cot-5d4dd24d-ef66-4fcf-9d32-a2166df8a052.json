    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",

    "output": "Firstly, we need to consider the total amount of home brew Tom needs, which is 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow, totaling 7 pints.\n\nSecondly, we need to consider how much each seller (Dick and Harry) can provide and at what price. \n\nHere is how we can formulate this problem:\n\nLet's denote:\n\nX1 = Pints Tom buys from Dick today\nX2 = Pints Tom buys from Dick tomorrow\nX3 = Pints Tom buys from Harry today\nX4 = Pints Tom buys from Harry tomorrow\n\nWe know that:\n\nX1 + X3 = 3 (Tom's requirement for today)\nX2 + X4 = 4 (Tom's requirement for tomorrow)\nX1 + X2 <= 5 (Dick's maximum amount)\nX3 + X4 <= 4 (Harry's maximum amount)\n\nAlso, Tom wants to minimize his cost, so we will be minimizing the following equation:\n\n3*X1 + 2.7*X2 + 2.9*X3 + 2.8*X4\n\nThis is a Linear Programming problem. We can use scipy's linprog function to solve this problem. Let me write the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients of objective function\nc = [3, 2.7, 2.9, 2.8]\n\n# Coefficients of inequality constraints\nA = [[-1, -1, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, -1, -1]]\n\n# Upper bound of inequality constraints\nb = [-5, -4]\n\n# Coefficients of equality constraints\nA_eq = [[1, 0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0, 1]]\n\n# Right-hand side of equality constraints\nb_eq = [3, 4]\n\nbounds = [(0, float(\"inf\"))] * 4\n\n# Solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=b_eq, bounds=bounds, method='highs')\n\n# Get the solution\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nThis code defines the problem and then calls `linprog` to solve it. The solution will be the minimum cost Tom needs to pay.",
