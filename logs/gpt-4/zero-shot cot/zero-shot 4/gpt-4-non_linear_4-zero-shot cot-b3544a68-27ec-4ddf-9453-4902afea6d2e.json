    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "The first step is to understand the problem. We have two products and their respective profits per unit are given. The total production capacity is two units per hour. Our goal is to find the optimal production mix to maximize the total profit. \n\nThe profits for both products are quadratic functions, which means the maximum profit for each product will be achieved at a certain production rate, after which the profit will decrease due to decreasing marginal returns. \n\nTo find the optimal production mix, we can use calculus. We will take the derivative of the total profit function, set it equal to zero, and solve for the production rates. The total profit function is the sum of the profit functions for both products:\n\nProfit_total = $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 + $300*R2 - $100*R2^2\n\nThis is subject to the constraint that R1 + R2 <= 2. \n\nWe need to find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize this function while satisfying the constraint. \n\nThis is a type of optimization problem known as quadratic programming. It can be solved using Python libraries such as scipy or cvxpy. Here is some sample Python code to solve this problem using cvxpy:\n\n```python\nimport cvxpy as cp\n\n# Define the decision variables\nR1 = cp.Variable()\nR2 = cp.Variable()\n\n# Define the objective function\nprofit = 200*R1 - 100*cp.square(R1) + 300*R2 - 100*cp.square(R2)\n\n# Define the constraints\nconstraints = [R1 + R2 <= 2, R1 >= 0, R2 >= 0]\n\n# Define the problem\nproblem = cp.Problem(cp.Maximize(profit), constraints)\n\n# Solve the problem\nsolution = problem.solve()\n\nprint('The maximum total profit is:', solution)\nprint('The optimal production rate for Product 1 is:', R1.value)\nprint('The optimal production rate for Product 2 is:', R2.value)\n```\n\nThis will give the maximum total profit and the optimal production rates to achieve that profit.",
