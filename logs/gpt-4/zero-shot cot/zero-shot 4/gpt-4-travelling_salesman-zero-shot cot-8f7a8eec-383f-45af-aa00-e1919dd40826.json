    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.",

    "output": "1. Create a list of lists, where each list represents a project and contains the employees that work on that project.\n2. Sort the projects in ascending order based on the number of employees.\n3. Start from the project with the least number of employees, and form a group with those employees.\n4. Remove the employees in the group from the other projects they are involved in.\n5. Repeat this process until all employees are in a group.\n6. The number of times an employee enters the room is the number of groups they are in.\n7. The total traffic in and out of the room is twice the sum of the number of groups each employee is in.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Assigning projects to employees\nprojects = [[], [2, 5, 7, 10], [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10], [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10], [1, 2, 4, 7, 10], [3, 6, 7, 9, 10]]\n\n# Sorting projects by number of employees\nprojects.sort(key=len)\n\n# Variable to store the total traffic\ntotal_traffic = 0\n\n# Loop over the projects\nwhile projects:\n    project = projects.pop(0)\n    total_traffic += len(project) * 2\n    \n    # Remove the employees in the group from other projects\n    for employee in project:\n        for other_project in projects:\n            if employee in other_project:\n                other_project.remove(employee)\n\n# Assigning the final solution\nsolution = total_traffic\n```\nThis code will minimize the total traffic in and out of the room by scheduling the meetings in a way that any employee who enters the room stays there until all their projects have been discussed. It assumes that the manager does not leave the room during the process.",
