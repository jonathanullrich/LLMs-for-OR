{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to create a 5x4 matrix (5 swimmers x 4 strokes) that contains all the times of the swimmers in each stroke. \n\nThen, we need to find the minimum time in each column (each stroke) and assign that swimmer to that stroke. We also need to make sure that each swimmer is only assigned to one stroke. \n\nIf a swimmer is assigned to a stroke, we need to remove that swimmer from the matrix and repeat the process to find the minimum time in each column from the remaining swimmers. \n\nWe will continue this process until we have assigned 4 swimmers to 4 strokes.\n\nWe should use combinatorial optimization technique such as Hungarian Algorithm to solve this problem, as it is designed to solve such type of assignment problems in polynomial time.\n\nLet's write the python code for this.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
