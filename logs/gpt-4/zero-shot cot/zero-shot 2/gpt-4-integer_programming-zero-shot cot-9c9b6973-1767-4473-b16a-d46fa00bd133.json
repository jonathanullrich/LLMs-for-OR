    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",

    "output": "Sure, let's first identify the tasks that each individual is more efficient at. For Eve, she is more efficient at Marketing (4.5 hours vs 4.9 hours), Dishwashing (3.6 hours vs 4.3 hours) and Laundry (2.9 hours vs 3.1 hours). For Steven, he is more efficient at Cooking (7.2 hours vs 7.8 hours).\n\nHowever, since each individual needs to do two tasks, we need to consider the total time for different combinations of tasks. Let's consider each individual's two most efficient tasks:\n\n1. Eve: Marketing and Dishwashing (4.5 hours + 3.6 hours = 8.1 hours)\n2. Eve: Marketing and Laundry (4.5 hours + 2.9 hours = 7.4 hours)\n3. Eve: Dishwashing and Laundry (3.6 hours + 2.9 hours = 6.5 hours)\n4. Steven: Cooking and Marketing (7.2 hours + 4.9 hours = 12.1 hours)\n5. Steven: Cooking and Dishwashing (7.2 hours + 4.3 hours = 11.5 hours)\n6. Steven: Cooking and Laundry (7.2 hours + 3.1 hours = 10.3 hours)\n\nThe quickest combinations would be for Eve to do the Dishwashing and Laundry (6.5 hours), and for Steven to do the Cooking and Marketing (10.3 hours). This would result in a total of 16.8 hours of work.\n\nHowever, this gives the task of Marketing to Steven, even though Eve is more efficient at it. Let's consider swapping Marketing and Laundry:\n\n1. Eve: Marketing and Dishwashing (4.5 hours + 3.6 hours = 8.1 hours)\n2. Steven: Cooking and Laundry (7.2 hours + 3.1 hours = 10.3 hours)\n\nThis results in a total of 18.4 hours of work. This is more time than the original split, so it would be better for Eve to do the Dishwashing and Laundry, and for Steven to do the Cooking and Marketing. This results in the minimum total time of 16.8 hours.",
