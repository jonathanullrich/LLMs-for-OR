    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.",

    "output": "First, we need to define the problem. It's a knapsack problem, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. We want to maximize the total value of the items in the backpack, given the constraint that the total volume of the items can't exceed the volume of the backpack.\n\nThe items can't be divided, so it's a 0/1 knapsack problem.\n\nThe items are the following:\n\n| Item | Volume (ft^3) | Value |\n|------|---------------|-------|\n| A    | 2             | 30    |\n| B    | 3             | 50    |\n| C    | 4             | 70    |\n\nThe volume of the backpack is 5 ft^3.\n\nWe need to find the combination of items that gives the maximum value without exceeding the volume of the backpack. \n\nWe can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here is the Python code for it:\n```python\ndef knapSack(W, wt, val, n):\n    K = [[0 for w in range(W+1)]\n            for i in range(n+1)]\n             \n    # Build table K[][] in bottom\n    # up manner\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        for w in range(W+1):\n            if i == 0 or w == 0:\n                K[i][w] = 0\n            elif wt[i-1] <= w:\n                K[i][w] = max(val[i-1]\n                  + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]],\n                               K[i-1][w])\n            else:\n                K[i][w] = K[i-1][w]\n \n    return K[n][W]\n     \n# Driver code\nval = [30, 50, 70]\nwt = [2, 3, 4]\nW = 5\nn = len(val)\n\nsolution = knapSack(W, wt, val, n)\nprint(solution)\n```\nThis Python function takes as input the volume of the backpack, the volumes and values of the items, and the total number of items. It then builds a 2D array where the element in the i-th row and j-th column represents the maximum value that can be obtained with a backpack of volume j using the first i items. It then returns the maximum value that can be obtained with the given backpack and items.",
