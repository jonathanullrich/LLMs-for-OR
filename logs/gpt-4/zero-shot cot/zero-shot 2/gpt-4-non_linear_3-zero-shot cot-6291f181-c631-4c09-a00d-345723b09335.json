    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",

    "output": "First, we need to define what we are looking for.\n\nWe want to find the mix of investments that will provide a return of 15 percent. This means we need to find the number of blocks of each stock that Ann should buy.\n\nLet's denote the number of blocks of stock 1 that Ann buys as x1 and the number of blocks of stock 2 as x2. We need to find the values of x1 and x2.\n\nWe can start by writing the objective function. Ann wants to maximize her return, so the objective function will be:\n\n5*x1 + 10*x2\n\nWe also have two constraints. The first constraint is that the total investment cannot exceed $50,000. Since the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2, this constraint can be written as:\n\n20*x1 + 30*x2 <= 50\n\nThe second constraint is that the return must be at least 15 percent. This can be written as:\n\n5*x1 + 10*x2 >= 15\n\nWe also know that the number of blocks of each stock cannot be negative, so we have two more constraints:\n\nx1 >= 0\nx2 >= 0\n\nWe can solve this problem using linear programming. Python has a built-in library for linear programming called scipy. We can use the linprog function from scipy.optimize to solve this problem. The linprog function minimizes a linear objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. In our case, we want to maximize the objective function, but we can achieve this by minimizing the negative of the objective function.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem:\n\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# coefficients of the objective function\nc = [-5, -10]\n\n# coefficients of the inequality constraints\nA = [[20, 30], [-5, -10]]\nb = [50, -15]\n\n# coefficients of the equality constraints\nA_eq = None\nb_eq = None\n\n# bounds for the variables\nx0_bounds = (0, None)\nx1_bounds = (0, None)\n\n# solve the problem\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=b_eq, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# print the optimal solution\nsolution = res.x\n\nprint('Ann should buy', solution[0], 'blocks of stock 1 and', solution[1], 'blocks of stock 2.')",
