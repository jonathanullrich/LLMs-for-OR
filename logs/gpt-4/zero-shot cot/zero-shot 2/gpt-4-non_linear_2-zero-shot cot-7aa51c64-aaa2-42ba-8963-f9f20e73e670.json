    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The optimum location is sought for an airfield from which the six airfields A to F can be approached. The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to define the objective function. The objective is to minimize the total flying distance, which is the sum of the distances from the optimal location to each of the other airfields, multiplied by the frequency of flights. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) can be calculated by the Euclidean distance formula, sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2).\n\nSecond, we need to define the constraints. The optimal location cannot be in the swamp area or the lake area, which are defined by the conditions x + y >= 250 and (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400, respectively.\n\nFinally, we can use an optimization method to find the optimal location that minimizes the objective function under these constraints. However, this may require a sophisticated tool like a mathematical solver or optimization software, which is beyond the scope of the current system. Therefore, we can't provide a direct solution to this problem right now.",
