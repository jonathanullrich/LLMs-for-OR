    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Firstly, we need to define the decision variables, objective function, and constraints. \n\nIn this case, our decision variables are the number of units of each product to be produced (x1, x2, x3). \n\nThe objective function is the total profit, which is a sum of the profits from each product. \n\nThe constraints are the limitations on the use of resources. \n\nNow let's define the function for each product's profitability. They are piecewise functions, which means they have different values depending on the range of the input.\n\nFinally, we will use an optimization algorithm to find the values of x1, x2 and x3 that maximize the total profit subject to the constraints.\n\nNote: This problem appears to be a mixed integer programming problem due to the piecewise profit functions and the constraints. However, Python's popular optimization library, SciPy, does not support mixed integer programming. You might need to use a specialized library like PuLP or Google OR-Tools, or make approximations to convert this into a continuous or a linear programming problem.",
