    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",

    "output": "First, we need to figure out the rental needs for each week. The needs for the next 4 weeks are 7, 4, 7, and 8.\n\nNext, we need to figure out the cost for each week. The rental cost per car per week is $220, and there's a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. \n\nIf Luxor keeps the rentals for an additional week, it would have to pay the rental cost for each car, but not the flat fee. So we need to compare the cost of renting new cars each week with the cost of keeping the rentals.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for each week:\n\nWeek 1: The need is 7 cars. So the cost is 7 * $220 + $500 = $1940.\n\nWeek 2: The need is 4 cars. If Luxor keeps 4 cars from last week and returns 3, the cost is 4 * $220 = $880. If Luxor returns all cars and rents new ones, the cost is 4 * $220 + $500 = $1380. So the cheaper option is to keep the cars.\n\nWeek 3: The need is 7 cars. If Luxor keeps 4 cars from last week and rents 3 new ones, the cost is 4 * $220 + 3 * ($220 + $500) = $3160. If Luxor returns all cars and rents new ones, the cost is 7 * $220 + $500 = $2040. So the cheaper option is to rent new cars.\n\nWeek 4: The need is 8 cars. If Luxor keeps 7 cars from last week and rents 1 new one, the cost is 7 * $220 + $220 + $500 = $1980. If Luxor returns all cars and rents new ones, the cost is 8 * $220 + $500 = $2260. So the cheaper option is to keep the cars.\n\nThe total minimal cost is $1940 (week 1) + $880 (week 2) + $2040 (week 3) + $1980 (week 4) = $6840.",
