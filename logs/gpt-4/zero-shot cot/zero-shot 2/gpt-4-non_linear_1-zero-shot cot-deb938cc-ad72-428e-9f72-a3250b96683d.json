    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First of all, we need to understand that the tax revenue is the product of the number of cigarettes sold and the tax per cigarette. In this case, the number of cigarettes sold is given by the function f = 53 - 100*(t/100), where t is the tax rate. The tax per cigarette is given by t/100 * 15 cents.\n\nSo, the total tax revenue R can be represented as:\n\nR = (53 - t) * (t/100 * 0.15)\n\nThis is a quadratic function, which reaches its maximum at t = -b/2a (from the quadratic formula ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b and c are constants).\n\nIn this case, a = -0.15, b = 53. So, the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is t = -53 / (2 * -0.15) = 176.67%.\n\nHowever, a tax rate above 100% does not make sense in this context, so we can conclude that the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue is 100%.\n\nHere is the Python code that calculates this:\n\n```python\na = -0.15\nb = 53\n\nt = -b / (2*a)\nif t > 100:\n    t = 100\n\nsolution = t\n```\n\nThis will give the solution as 100.0.",
