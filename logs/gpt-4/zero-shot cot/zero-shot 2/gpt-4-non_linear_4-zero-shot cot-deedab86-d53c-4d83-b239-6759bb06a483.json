    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Firstly, we know that the total number of products produced per hour cannot exceed 2. This means R1 + R2 <= 2.\n\nSecondly, we know that the profit from each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. This means we want to find the maximum possible profit given the constraints.\n\nThe profit from product 1 is given by P1 = $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 and from product 2 is P2 = $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Our goal is to maximize the total profit P = P1 + P2.\n\nWe can use optimization techniques to find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize P. These techniques involve setting up a system of equations based on the constraints and then finding the values that satisfy these equations and result in the maximum P.\n\nIn Python, we can use the scipy.optimize library to help us solve this system of equations. However, the scipy.optimize library minimizes functions, so we need to re-phrase our problem as a minimization problem by finding the values that minimize -P. \n\nWe will use the scipy.optimize.minimize function, which minimizes a scalar function of one or more variables. In our case, our variables are R1 and R2, and our function is -P.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef profit_rate(x):\n    R1, R2 = x\n    P1 = 200*R1 - 100*R1**2\n    P2 = 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\n    return -(P1 + P2)\n\nconstraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: 2 - sum(x)})\n\ninitial_guess = [1, 1]\nresult = minimize(profit_rate, initial_guess, constraints=constraints)\n\nsolution = -result.fun\n```\n\nThe 'solution' variable now contains the maximum possible total profit per hour.",
