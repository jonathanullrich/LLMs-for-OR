    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "The jobs should be processed in such a way that the job with the earliest deadline is done first. \n\nThe earliest deadline is for Job 2 which must be completed by the end of day 4. This job takes 4 days to process, so we must start with this job.\n\nNext, the earliest deadline is for Job 1 which must be completed by the end of day 8. This job takes 6 days to process, but since we already spent 4 days on Job 2, we have only 4 more days left. So, it's impossible to finish Job 1 within its deadline if we do Job 2 first.\n\nSo, we have to start with Job 1. It will take 6 days. Then we do Job 2 which will take additional 4 days. So, by the end of day 10, we have completed Jobs 1 and 2.\n\nNext, we have Job 3 that must be completed by end of day 12 and it takes 5 days to process. But we already spent 10 days on Jobs 1 and 2. So, we cannot finish Job 3 within its deadline if we do Jobs 1 and 2 first.\n\nTherefore, the deadlines given in the problem are mutually exclusive which means we cannot process all jobs within their respective deadlines. The only way to process all jobs is to ignore their deadlines.\n\nIf we ignore the deadlines, the minimal time to process all jobs is simply the sum of their processing times, which is 6 days for Job 1, 4 days for Job 2, 5 days for Job 3 and 8 days for Job 4.",
