    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we know that Tom needs to buy 7 pints in total: 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow. \n\nSecond, we need to consider the price. Dick offers a lower price per pint tomorrow, while Harry offers a lower price per pint today. So, it seems reasonable for Tom to buy as much as possible from Harry today and from Dick tomorrow.\n\nThird, we need to consider the quantity. Dick can only sell 5 pints in total and Harry can only sell 4 pints in total. \n\nSo, let's try to solve it step by step:\n\n1. Today: Tom buys 3 pints from Harry at $2.90 each, which costs $8.70. \n\n2. Tomorrow: Tom buys 4 pints from Dick at $2.70 each, which costs $10.80. \n\nThe total cost is $19.50.\n\nNow, it is possible that Tom can't buy all 3 pints from Harry today or all 4 pints from Dick tomorrow due to their maximum selling quantities. Let's consider the alternatives:\n\n- If Tom can't buy all 3 pints from Harry today, he can buy the remaining from Dick at $3.00 per pint.\n- If Tom can't buy all 4 pints from Dick tomorrow, he can buy the remaining from Harry at $2.80 per pint. \n\nLet's calculate the total cost for these alternatives:\n\n1. Today: Tom buys 2 pints from Harry at $2.90 each and 1 pint from Dick at $3.00, which costs $8.80. \n\n2. Tomorrow: Tom buys 3 pints from Dick at $2.70 each and 1 pint from Harry at $2.80, which costs $10.60. \n\nThe total cost is $19.40, which is slightly cheaper than the first option. \n\nSo, the optimal purchase plan is:\n\n- Today: buy 2 pints from Harry and 1 pint from Dick.\n- Tomorrow: buy 3 pints from Dick and 1 pint from Harry.\n\nThis solution minimizes the cost while satisfying the thirst requirements. The minimum total cost is $19.40.",
