{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to define our decision variables. We can consider x1 as the fraction of a full partnership in the first friend's venture, and x2 as the fraction of a full partnership in the second friend's venture.\n\nNext, we need to set up our objective function. We aim to maximize our total estimated profit, which is 9000*x1 + 9000*x2.\n\nFurthermore, we have constraints related to the total money investment, which cannot exceed $12,000, and the total time investment, which cannot exceed 600 hours. So we have the following constraints: 10000*x1 + 8000*x2 <= 12000 and 400*x1 + 500*x2 <= 600.\n\nSince both x1 and x2 represent fractions of a full partnership, they should be between 0 and 1.\n\nAll these can be implemented in python using scipy's linprog function.\n\nHere is the python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients in the objective function\nc = [-9000, -9000]\n\n# Inequality constraints matrix\nA = [[10000, 8000], [400, 500]]\n\n# Inequality constraints vector\nb = [12000, 600]\n\n# Bounds of the variables\nx0_bounds = (0, 1)\nx1_bounds = (0, 1)\n\n# Use linprog function to find the optimal solution\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Print the optimal solution\nsolution = res.fun\nprint(-solution)\n```\n\nThis code will print the maximum total estimated profit that you can achieve by participating in your friends' ventures. Please note that we use negative coefficients in the objective function and then negate the result because linprog function minimizes the objective function by default.", "code": "from scipy.optimize import linprog\n\n# Coefficients in the objective function\nc = [-9000, -9000]\n\n# Inequality constraints matrix\nA = [[10000, 8000], [400, 500]]\n\n# Inequality constraints vector\nb = [12000, 600]\n\n# Bounds of the variables\nx0_bounds = (0, 1)\nx1_bounds = (0, 1)\n\n# Use linprog function to find the optimal solution\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')\n\n# Print the optimal solution\nsolution = res.fun\nprint(-solution)", "solution": -12000.0}
