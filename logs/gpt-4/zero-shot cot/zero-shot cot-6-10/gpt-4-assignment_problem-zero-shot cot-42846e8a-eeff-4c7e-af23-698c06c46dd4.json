{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to arrange the data in a form we can work with. We can create a dictionary where each key is a swimmer's name and the value is another dictionary where the keys are the strokes and the values are the times for each stroke.\n\nSecond, we need to find all possible combinations of four swimmers.\n\nThird, for each combination, we need to find the optimal assignment of strokes to swimmers. To do this, we need to find all permutations of the four strokes and for each permutation, calculate the total time if the strokes are assigned according to the permutation.\n\nFourth, we need to keep track of the minimum total time and the corresponding assignment.\n\nFinally, we can return the minimum total time.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
