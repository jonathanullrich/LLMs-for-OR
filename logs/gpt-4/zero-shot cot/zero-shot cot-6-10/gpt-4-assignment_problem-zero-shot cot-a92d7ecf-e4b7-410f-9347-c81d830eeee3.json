Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break it down. \n\nFirst, we need to recognize that this is a classic assignment problem, which can be solved using the Hungarian Algorithm. The Hungarian algorithm is a combinatorial optimization method that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time and was developed and published by Harold Kuhn in 1955.\n\nNext, we can create a cost matrix where each row represents a swimmer, and each column represents a stroke. The value in each cell would be the time it takes for the swimmer to complete the stroke.\n\nOur task then is to assign each swimmer to a unique stroke such that the total time is minimized. This is the same as selecting a single cell from each row and column in the cost matrix such that the sum of the selected cell values is minimized.\n\nWe can use the Munkres (also known as the Hungarian) algorithm to solve this, which is available in Python via the munkres module.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom munkres import Munkres, print_matrix\n\nmatrix = [[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n          [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n          [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n          [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n          [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]  # Ken\n\nm = Munkres()\nindexes = m.compute(matrix)\nprint_matrix(matrix, msg='Lowest cost through this matrix:')\ntotal = 0\nfor row, column in indexes:\n    value = matrix[row][column]\n    total += value\n    print(f'({row}, {column}) -> {value}')\nprint(f'total cost: {total}')\n```\n\nIn the code above, we first import the Munkres module and create the cost matrix. We then create an instance of Munkres and use it to compute the optimal assignment. The algorithm returns a list of (row, column) pairs that represent the optimal assignment. We then sum up the cell values for these assignments to get the total time.", "code": "from munkres import Munkres, print_matrix\n\nmatrix = [[37.7, 43.4, 33.3, 29.2],  # Carl\n          [32.9, 33.1, 28.5, 26.4],  # Chris\n          [33.8, 42.2, 38.9, 29.6],  # David\n          [37.0, 34.7, 30.4, 28.5],  # Tony\n          [35.4, 41.8, 33.6, 31.1]]  # Ken\n\nm = Munkres()\nindexes = m.compute(matrix)\nprint_matrix(matrix, msg='Lowest cost through this matrix:')\ntotal = 0\nfor row, column in indexes:\n    value = matrix[row][column]\n    total += value\n    print(f'({row}, {column}) -> {value}')\nprint(f'total cost: {total}')", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
