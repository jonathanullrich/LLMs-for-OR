Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Tom needs 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow. This is his demand.\n2. Dick can sell 5 pints in total, either today or tomorrow, with a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow.\n3. Harry can sell 4 pints in total, either today or tomorrow, with a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow.\n4. Tom wants to minimize his cost.\n\nThis problem can be solved using linear programming.\n\nLet's denote:\n- x1: pints bought from Dick today\n- x2: pints bought from Harry today\n- y1: pints bought from Dick tomorrow\n- y2: pints bought from Harry tomorrow\n\nTherefore, the objective function to minimize is:\n\nCost = 3*x1 + 2.9*x2 + 2.7*y1 + 2.8*y2\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\nx1 + x2 = 3 (Tom's demand for today)\ny1 + y2 = 4 (Tom's demand for tomorrow)\nx1 + y1 <= 5 (Dick's maximum supply)\nx2 + y2 <= 4 (Harry's maximum supply)\n\nAll variables must be non-negative.\n\nWe can use the python library 'PuLP' to solve this problem. Here is the python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom pulp import LpMinimize, LpProblem, LpStatus, lpSum, LpVariable\n\n# Define the model\nmodel = LpProblem(name=\"minimum-cost\", sense=LpMinimize)\n\n# Initialize the decision variables\nx1 = LpVariable(name=\"x1\", lowBound=0)\nx2 = LpVariable(name=\"x2\", lowBound=0)\ny1 = LpVariable(name=\"y1\", lowBound=0)\ny2 = LpVariable(name=\"y2\", lowBound=0)\n\n# Add the constraints to the model\nmodel += (x1 + x2 == 3, \"today_demand\")\nmodel += (y1 + y2 == 4, \"tomorrow_demand\")\nmodel += (x1 + y1 <= 5, \"dick_supply\")\nmodel += (x2 + y2 <= 4, \"harry_supply\")\n\n# Set the objective\nmodel += 3*x1 + 2.9*x2 + 2.7*y1 + 2.8*y2\n\n# Solve the problem\nstatus = model.solve()\n\nsolution = LpStatus[status]\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"status: {solution}, \\n\")\nfor var in model.variables():\n    print(f\"{var.name}: {var.value()}\")\nprint(f\"minimum cost: {model.objective.value()}\")\n```\n\nThis code will give us the amount of pints Tom should buy from each person each day to minimize his cost while satisfying his demand.", "code": "from pulp import LpMinimize, LpProblem, LpStatus, lpSum, LpVariable\n\n# Define the model\nmodel = LpProblem(name=\"minimum-cost\", sense=LpMinimize)\n\n# Initialize the decision variables\nx1 = LpVariable(name=\"x1\", lowBound=0)\nx2 = LpVariable(name=\"x2\", lowBound=0)\ny1 = LpVariable(name=\"y1\", lowBound=0)\ny2 = LpVariable(name=\"y2\", lowBound=0)\n\n# Add the constraints to the model\nmodel += (x1 + x2 == 3, \"today_demand\")\nmodel += (y1 + y2 == 4, \"tomorrow_demand\")\nmodel += (x1 + y1 <= 5, \"dick_supply\")\nmodel += (x2 + y2 <= 4, \"harry_supply\")\n\n# Set the objective\nmodel += 3*x1 + 2.9*x2 + 2.7*y1 + 2.8*y2\n\n# Solve the problem\nstatus = model.solve()\n\nsolution = LpStatus[status]\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"status: {solution}, \\n\")\nfor var in model.variables():\n    print(f\"{var.name}: {var.value()}\")\nprint(f\"minimum cost: {model.objective.value()}\")", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
