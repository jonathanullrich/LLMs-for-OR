Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we know that the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. That means R1 + R2 <= 2.\n\nSecond, we know that the profits from each product are given by $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 and $300*R2 - $100*R2^2 respectively. \n\nTo maximize the total profit, we need to find the values of R1 and R2 that maximize the total profit while still satisfying the constraint R1 + R2 <= 2.\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem. We can solve this problem using calculus or optimization algorithms. We will find the maximum point of the profit function subject to the constraint.\n\nLet's write the problem mathematically:\nMaximize P = $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 + $300*R2 - $100*R2^2\nsubject to R1 + R2 <= 2 and R1, R2 >= 0\n\nNow, let's solve this problem using python: \n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nR1, R2 = sp.symbols('R1 R2')\n\n# Define the profit function\nP = 200*R1 - 100*R1**2 + 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\n\n# Use sympy's solve function to find the maximum point\nsolution = sp.solve([sp.diff(P, R1), sp.diff(P, R2), R1 + R2 - 2, R1, R2], (R1, R2))\n\n# The solution is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a possible solution.\n# We need to check which solution satisfies the constraints and gives the maximum profit.\n\nmax_profit = -sp.oo  # Initialize max_profit as negative infinity\nfor sol in solution:\n    if sol[0] >= 0 and sol[1] >= 0 and sol[0] + sol[1] <= 2:\n        profit = P.subs({R1: sol[0], R2: sol[1]})\n        if profit > max_profit:\n            max_profit = profit\n\nprint(f'The maximum profit is: ${max_profit}')\n```\n\nThis problem can also be solved using optimization libraries such as scipy.optimize, but here we presented a simple solution using sympy.", "code": "import sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nR1, R2 = sp.symbols('R1 R2')\n\n# Define the profit function\nP = 200*R1 - 100*R1**2 + 300*R2 - 100*R2**2\n\n# Use sympy's solve function to find the maximum point\nsolution = sp.solve([sp.diff(P, R1), sp.diff(P, R2), R1 + R2 - 2, R1, R2], (R1, R2))\n\n# The solution is a list of tuples.
