{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to define our decision variables. Let's call them x1, x2, and x3. They represent whether or not to take each item (1 if we take it, 0 if we don't).\n\nNext, we need to create our objective function. Our objective is to maximize the total value of the items we take, so our objective function will be 30*x1 + 50*x2 + 70*x3.\n\nLastly, we need to define our constraints. We have only one constraint: the total volume of the items we take cannot exceed the volume of the backpack, which is 5 ft^3. So our constraint is 2*x1 + 3*x2 + 4*x3 <= 5.\n\nWe can solve this problem using binary integer programming. Python has a library called PuLP that can solve these kinds of problems. Let's see the code.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
