{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure. The goal is to maximize the total profit subject to the constraint that the total production cannot exceed two units per hour. \n\nIn mathematical terms, we want to maximize the following objective function:\n\n    Profit = $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 + $300*R2 - $100*R2^2\n\nsubject to the constraint that:\n\n    R1 + R2 <= 2\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem. There are many methods to solve these types of problems. One common method is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but in this case, it may be simpler to use a numerical method since the objective function is not too complicated.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to solve this problem. In this case, we actually minimize the negative of the profit function since `scipy.optimize.minimize` does not have a maximization function.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
