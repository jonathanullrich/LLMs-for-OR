{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to understand that this is a knapsack problem. This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach.\n\nThe knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight (in our case volume) and a value, determine the number and types of items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit (in our case the backpack's volume) and the total value is as large as possible. \n\nOur objective is to maximize the total value of the items in the backpack.\n\nWe can solve this using dynamic programming by building a table where the rows represent each item and the columns represent the capacity of the backpack. Each cell in the table will represent the maximum value we can get by using that item and the remaining capacity of the backpack.\n\nLet's write the code for that.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
