{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "examples": null, "output": "First, let's list out all the possible combinations of chores that Eve and Steven can do. Since each of them needs to do two chores, there are 6 combinations for each:\n\n1. Marketing and Cooking\n2. Marketing and Dishwashing\n3. Marketing and Laundry\n4. Cooking and Dishwashing\n5. Cooking and Laundry\n6. Dishwashing and Laundry\n\nThen, for each of these combinations, we need to calculate the total time it would take for Eve and Steven to complete their chores. For example, if Eve does Marketing and Cooking, and Steven does Dishwashing and Laundry, the total time would be 4.5 + 7.8 for Eve and 4.3 + 3.1 for Steven. \n\nWe need to do this for all possible combinations and then choose the one with the minimum total time. \n\nLet's write the python code to do this.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
