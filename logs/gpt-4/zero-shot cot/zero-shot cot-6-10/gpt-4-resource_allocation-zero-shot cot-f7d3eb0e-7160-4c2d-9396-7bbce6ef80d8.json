The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "To solve this problem, we need to consider two possibilities: \n\n1) Luxor Travel rents the cars every week. \nIn this case, the cost would be the rental fee multiplied by the number of cars, plus the transaction fee for every week.\n\n2) Luxor Travel rents the cars for the whole period (4 weeks). \nIn this case, the cost would be the rental fee multiplied by the number of cars for 4 weeks, plus one transaction fee. \n\nHowever, Luxor Travel must have enough cars to satisfy the maximum demand for any given week. \n\nLet's calculate the costs for both scenarios:\n\n1) Weekly rentals:\n\n```python\nweek_cars = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nweekly_cost = sum([cars * 220 + 500 for cars in week_cars])\n```\n\n2) Whole period rental:\n\n```python\nperiod_cars = max(week_cars)\nperiod_cost = period_cars * 220 * 4 + 500\n```\n\nThen, we can compare both costs and choose the minimal one. \n\n```python\nsolution = min(weekly_cost, period_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the cost for both scenarios and choose the minimal one, thus solving the problem.", "code": "week_cars = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nweekly_cost = sum([cars * 220 + 500 for cars in week_cars])\nperiod_cars = max(week_cars)\nperiod_cost = period_cars * 220 * 4 + 500\nsolution = min(weekly_cost, period_cost)", "solution": 7540}
