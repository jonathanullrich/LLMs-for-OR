The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we need to figure out the order of the jobs to minimize the total time. So, we need to prioritize the jobs based on their deadlines and processing times.\n\nIn this case, Job 2 has the shortest deadline and should be done first, followed by Job 1, Job 3, and finally Job 4.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal time to process the jobs:\n\n- Day 1-4: Process Job 2 (4 days)\n- Day 5-10: Process Job 1 (6 days)\n- Day 11-15: Process Job 3 (5 days)\n- Day 16-23: Process Job 4 (8 days)\n\nSo, the minimal time to process the jobs is 23 days.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
