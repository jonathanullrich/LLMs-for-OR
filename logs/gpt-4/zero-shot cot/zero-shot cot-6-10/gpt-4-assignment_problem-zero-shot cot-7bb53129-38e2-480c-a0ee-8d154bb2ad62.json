Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, here is a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:\n\nStep 1: Define the problem in terms of decision variables, objective function, and constraints. \n\n- Decision Variables: We need to assign one swimmer to each stroke. Let's denote it as Xij where i is the swimmer (i = 1,2,3,4,5 for Carl, Chris, David, Tony, Ken respectively) and j is the stroke (j = 1,2,3,4 for Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly, Freestyle respectively). Xij = 1 if swimmer i is assigned to stroke j, 0 otherwise.\n\n- Objective Function: We want to minimize the total time, which is the sum of the best times of each swimmer for their assigned stroke. \n\n- Constraints: Each swimmer can only be assigned to one stroke and each stroke can only be assigned to one swimmer.\n\nStep 2: Formulate the problem as a linear programming problem.\n\nStep 3: Solve the problem using a linear programming solver.\n\nStep 4: Interpret the solution to determine the minimum time and the assignment of swimmers to strokes. \n\nNow let's proceed with coding. We'll use the 'pulp' library in Python which allows us to solve linear programming problems.\n\nHere is the Python code: \n\n```python\nfrom pulp import *\n\n# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data\nprob = LpProblem(\"Swim Team Assignment\", LpMinimize)\n\n# Create decision variables\nx = LpVariable.dicts(\"Swimmer_to_Stroke\",((i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(4)),cat='Binary')\n\n# Create the objective function\ntimes = {('Carl', 'Backstroke'): 37.7, ('Chris', 'Backstroke'): 32.9, ('David', 'Backstroke'): 33.8, \n         ('Tony', 'Backstroke'): 37.0, ('Ken', 'Backstroke'): 35.4, ('Carl', 'Breaststroke'): 43.4, \n         ('Chris', 'Breaststroke'): 33.1, ('David', 'Breaststroke'): 42.2, ('Tony', 'Breaststroke'): 34.7, \n         ('Ken', 'Breaststroke'): 41.8, ('Carl', 'Butterfly'): 33.3, ('Chris', 'Butterfly'): 28.5, \n         ('David', 'Butterfly'): 38.9, ('Tony', 'Butterfly'): 30.4, ('Ken', 'Butterfly'): 33.6, \n         ('Carl', 'Freestyle'): 29.2, ('Chris', 'Freestyle'): 26.4, ('David', 'Freestyle'): 29.6, \n         ('Tony', 'Freestyle'): 28.5, ('Ken', 'Freestyle'): 31.1}\nprob += lpSum([x[i,j]*times[i,j] for i,j in x])\n\n# Create constraints\nfor i in range(5):\n    prob += lpSum([x[(i,j)] for j in range(4)]) <= 1\nfor j in range(4):\n    prob += lpSum([x[(i,j)] for i in range(5)]) == 1\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Print the minimum time\nsolution = value(prob.objective)\n```\nIn the above code, we first define our decision variables, then define the objective function which is the sum of the best times for each swimmer for their assigned stroke. We then add constraints to ensure each swimmer can only be assigned to one stroke and each stroke can only be assigned to one swimmer. Finally, we solve the problem and print the minimum time.", "code": "from pulp import *\n\n# Create the 'prob' variable to contain the problem data\nprob = LpProblem(\"Swim Team Assignment\", LpMinimize)\n\n# Create decision variables\nx = LpVariable.dicts(\"Swimmer_to_Stroke\",((i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(4)),cat='Binary')\n\n# Create the objective function\ntimes = {('Carl', 'Backstroke'): 37.7, ('Chris', 'Backstroke'): 32.9, ('David', 'Backstroke'): 33.8, \n         ('Tony', 'Backstroke'): 37.0, ('Ken', 'Backstroke'): 35.4, ('Carl', 'Breaststroke'): 43.4, \n         ('Chris', 'Breaststroke'): 33.1, ('David', 'Breaststroke'): 42.2, ('Tony', 'Breaststroke'): 34.7, \n         ('Ken', 'Breaststroke'): 41.8, ('Carl', 'Butterfly'): 33.3, ('Chris', 'Butterfly'): 28.5, \n         ('David', 'Butterfly'): 38.9, ('Tony', 'Butterfly'): 30.4, ('Ken', 'Butterfly'): 33.6, \n         ('Carl', 'Freestyle'): 29.2, ('Chris', 'Freestyle'): 26.4, ('David', 'Freestyle'): 29.6, \n         ('Tony', 'Freestyle'): 28.5, ('Ken', 'Freestyle'): 31.1}\nprob += lpSum([x[i,j]*times[i,j] for i,j in x])\n\n# Create constraints\nfor i in range(5):\n    prob += lpSum([x[(i,j)] for j in range(4)]) <= 1\nfor j in range(4):\n    prob += lpSum([x[(i,j)] for i in range(5)]) == 1\n\n# Solve the problem\nprob.solve()\n\n# Print the minimum time\nsolution = value(prob.objective)", "solution": "RUNTIME_ERROR"}
