The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "To determine the minimal cost, we need to consider two options for each week: \n\n1. Returning the cars at the end of the week and renting a new set for the next week. In this case, the cost would be the sum of the rental fee for each car and the transaction fee.\n\n2. Keeping the cars for an additional week. In this case, the cost would be the rental fee for each car but without the transaction fee.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code to solve this problem: \n\n```python\ndef minimum_cost(rental_needs):\n    weeks = len(rental_needs)\n    costs = [0 for _ in range(weeks)]\n    for i in range(weeks):\n        if i == 0:\n            costs[i] = 7*220 + 500\n        else:\n            # Calculate the cost of returning the cars and renting new ones\n            cost1 = rental_needs[i]*220 + 500\n            # Calculate the cost of keeping the cars for an additional week\n            cost2 = max(rental_needs[i-1], rental_needs[i])*220\n            costs[i] = min(cost1, cost2 + costs[i-1])\n    return costs[-1]\n\nrental_needs = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nsolution = minimum_cost(rental_needs)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the minimal cost for each week, considering the two options, and then returns the total minimal cost. The `minimum_cost` function takes as input a list of rental needs for each week and returns the minimal total cost. The `rental_needs` list is [7, 4, 7, 8], which represents the number of rental cars needed for each week. The final output is assigned to the variable 'solution'.", "code": "def minimum_cost(rental_needs):\n    weeks = len(rental_needs)\n    costs = [0 for _ in range(weeks)]\n    for i in range(weeks):\n        if i == 0:\n            costs[i] = 7*220 + 500\n        else:\n            # Calculate the cost of returning the cars and renting new ones\n            cost1 = rental_needs[i]*220 + 500\n            # Calculate the cost of keeping the cars for an additional week\n            cost2 = max(rental_needs[i-1], rental_needs[i])*220\n            costs[i] = min(cost1, cost2 + costs[i-1])\n    return costs[-1]\n\nrental_needs = [7, 4, 7, 8]\nsolution = minimum_cost(rental_needs)", "solution": 2260}
