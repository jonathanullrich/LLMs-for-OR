{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": "Sure. We can solve this problem using linear programming. The first step is to define the decision variables.\n\nLet's denote:\n- x1 as the number of units of product 1 to produce\n- x2 as the number of units of product 2 to produce\n\nThe next step is to define the objective function. WorldLight Company wants to maximize profit. The profit from each unit of product 1 is $1 and from each unit of product 2 is $2. So, the objective function is:\n\nmaximize: P = x1 + 2*x2 \n\nThe next step is to define the constraints. The constraints of the problem are from the limited resources. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Also, the company can't produce more than 60 units of product 2 as it brings no profit. So, the constraints are:\n\n1*x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (from the limited frame parts)\n2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (from the limited electrical components)\nx2 <= 60 (can't produce more than 60 units of product 2)\nx1, x2 >= 0 (can't produce negative units of products)\n\nThe final step is to solve the linear programming problem. We can use Python's Scipy library to solve this.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
