{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": "Sure. \n\nThe first step is to understand that this is a Linear Programming problem. The goal is to maximize profit, subject to constraints on the number of frame parts and electrical components available.\n\nLet's denote:\n- x1: number of units of product 1\n- x2: number of units of product 2\n\nThe profit function to maximize is:\nP = x1 + 2*x2\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. x1 + 3*x2 <= 200 (frame parts)\n2. 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300 (electrical components)\n3. x2 <= 60 (product 2 units)\n4. x1, x2 >= 0 (can't produce negative units)\n\nWe can solve this problem using Linear Programming methods. Let's use the python library scipy's optimize.linprog() function. We need to remember that linprog() minimizes the function by default, so we will use -P.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
