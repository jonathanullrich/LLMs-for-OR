Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, here is how Tom should proceed:\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- x1: The amount of home brew to buy from Dick today.\n- x2: The amount of home brew to buy from Dick tomorrow.\n- y1: The amount of home brew to buy from Harry today.\n- y2: The amount of home brew to buy from Harry tomorrow.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the cost, which is given by: \n   cost = 3*x1 + 2.7*x2 + 2.9*y1 + 2.8*y2.\n\nThe constraints are as follows:\n- Tom's requirement for today: x1 + y1 = 3.\n- Tom's requirement for tomorrow: x2 + y2 = 4.\n- Dick's maximum for today and tomorrow: x1 + x2 <= 5.\n- Harry's maximum for today and tomorrow: y1 + y2 <= 4.\n\nThis is a linear programming problem, and we can use Python's Scipy library to solve it.
