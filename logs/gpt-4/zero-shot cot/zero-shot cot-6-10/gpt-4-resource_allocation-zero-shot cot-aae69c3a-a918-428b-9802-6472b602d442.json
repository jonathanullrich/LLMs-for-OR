{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to determine the total number of cars needed for the 4 weeks. We can then determine the total cost of renting these cars for each week.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the flat fee. Luxor Travel will need to pay this fee each time they rent cars, so they will want to minimize the number of times they rent. \n\nThe best way for Luxor Travel to handle this situation would be to rent the maximum number of cars needed for any week right at the start. This way, they only pay the flat fee once. They can then keep the cars for the additional weeks and pay the rental fee for the number of cars they need each week.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal cost.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
