{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to analyze which chores are more efficient for each person. We see that Eve is more efficient at Marketing, Dishwashing, and Laundry, while Steven is more efficient at Cooking. \n\nHowever, since each person has to do two tasks, we'll have to go beyond simply assigning the most efficient task to each person. We need to find the combination of two tasks for each person that results in the smallest total time. \n\nEve's combinations are:\n1. Marketing + Cooking = 4.5 + 7.8 = 12.3 hours\n2. Marketing + Dishwashing = 4.5 + 3.6 = 8.1 hours\n3. Marketing + Laundry = 4.5 + 2.9 = 7.4 hours\n4. Cooking + Dishwashing = 7.8 + 3.6 = 11.4 hours\n5. Cooking + Laundry = 7.8 + 2.9 = 10.7 hours\n6. Dishwashing + Laundry = 3.6 + 2.9 = 6.5 hours\n\nSteven's combinations are:\n1. Marketing + Cooking = 4.9 + 7.2 = 12.1 hours\n2. Marketing + Dishwashing = 4.9 + 4.3 = 9.2 hours\n3. Marketing + Laundry = 4.9 + 3.1 = 8 hours\n4. Cooking + Dishwashing = 7.2 + 4.3 = 11.5 hours\n5. Cooking + Laundry = 7.2 + 3.1 = 10.3 hours\n6. Dishwashing + Laundry = 4.3 + 3.1 = 7.4 hours\n\nFrom the above, the quickest combination for Eve is Dishwashing + Laundry (6.5 hours) and for Steven is Cooking + Laundry (10.3 hours). However, since both combinations include laundry, these cannot be done by both.\n\nSo, the next quickest combination for Eve is Marketing + Laundry (7.4 hours) and for Steven is still Cooking + Laundry (10.3 hours). These combinations include different tasks and can be done by both. So, this results in a total of 7.4 + 10.3 = 17.7 hours.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
