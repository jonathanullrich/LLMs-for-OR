The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, jobs should be processed according to their due date in ascending order. The order is: Job 2, Job 1, Job 3, Job 4.\n\nAnd since we can't interrupt a job once it has started, we can't start Job 2 at day 4, because it won't finish until day 8, which is too late.\n\nSo, we should start with Job 2 at day 0, and it will finish at day 4.\n\nThen, we start Job 1 at day 4, and it will finish at day 10, which is later than its due date. But it's the best we can do, because we can't start it earlier.\n\nNext, we start Job 3 at day 10, and it will finish at day 15.\n\nFinally, we start Job 4 at day 15, and it will finish at day 23.\n\nSo, the minimal time to process all jobs is 23 days.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
