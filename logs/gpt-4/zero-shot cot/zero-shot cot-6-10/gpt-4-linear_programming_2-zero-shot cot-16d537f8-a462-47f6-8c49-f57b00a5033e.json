{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we need to find out the profit per hour for each venture. This will give us an idea of which venture is more profitable on a per hour basis.\n\nFor the first friend\u2019s venture, the profit per hour is $9,000 / 400 hours = $22.5 per hour.\n\nFor the second friend\u2019s venture, the profit per hour is $9,000 / 500 hours = $18 per hour.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the first friend\u2019s venture is more profitable on a per hour basis.\n\nNext, we have to consider the amount of money that we can invest. We have $12,000 to invest, but the first friend\u2019s venture requires $10,000 for a full partnership. This means that if we want to invest in both ventures, we cannot be a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture.\n\nLet's assume that we invest x fraction in the first venture and y fraction in the second venture.\n\nWe can write down the following constraints:\n\n1) The total money investment should not exceed $12,000:\n\n    10,000x + 8,000y \u2264 12,000\n\n2) The total time investment should not exceed 600 hours:\n\n    400x + 500y \u2264 600\n\n3) Both x and y should be between 0 and 1 (because they represent fractions of a full partnership):\n\n    0 \u2264 x \u2264 1\n    0 \u2264 y \u2264 1\n\nOur objective is to maximize the total estimated profit, which is:\n\n    9,000x + 9,000y\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use linear programming. Python has several libraries for linear programming, such as scipy.optimize.linprog. Let's use this library to solve our problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
