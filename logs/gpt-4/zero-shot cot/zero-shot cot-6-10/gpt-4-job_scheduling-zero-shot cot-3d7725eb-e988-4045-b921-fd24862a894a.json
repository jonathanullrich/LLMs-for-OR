The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": "Ok, let's break it down.\n\nThe first thing to notice is that Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4 and it takes 4 days to complete, which means Job 2 must be started first.\n\nAfter Job 2 is done, there are 4 days left to complete Job 1 and make it by the end of day 8, so Job 1 must be started immediately after Job 2.\n\nNext, Job 3 needs to be finished by the end of day 12 and it takes 5 days to complete, so it can be started after Job 1 and it will be done by day 10.\n\nFinally, Job 4 can be started after Job 3 and it will be finished by day 18.\n\nSo, the minimal time to process all jobs is 18 days.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
