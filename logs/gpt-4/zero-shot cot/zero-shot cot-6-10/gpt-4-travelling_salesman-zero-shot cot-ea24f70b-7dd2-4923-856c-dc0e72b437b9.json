Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A manager has ten employees working on six projects. Employee 1 works on projects 2, 4, 5. Employee 2 works on projects 1, 3, 5. Employee 3 works on projects 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 4 works on projects 3, 4, 5. Employee 5 works on projects 1, 2, 3. Employee 6 works on projects 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Employee 7 works on projects 1, 2, 5, 6. Employee 8 works on projects 1, 3, 4. Employee 9 works on projects 5, 6. Employee 10 works on projects 1, 2, 4, 5, 6. Currently, the manager meets with each employee individually once a week. To reduce the time spend, the manager wants to hold group meetings depending on shared projects. The objective is to schedule the order of meetings to reduce the traffic (number of employees) in and out of the meeting room. Determine the minimal number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room.", "examples": null, "output": "Yes, let's break it down:\n\n1. We should first create a matrix where the rows represent the employees and the columns represent the projects. If an employee is working on a project, the corresponding cell in the matrix will be 1, otherwise it will be 0.\n\n2. After creating this matrix, we can then determine the common projects among the employees.\n\n3. We can then group the employees based on the common projects. The aim is to minimize the number of groups since each group will have a meeting. \n\n4. Finally, we will count the number of employees in each group. The number of employees entering or leaving the meeting room will be equal to the sum of the number of employees in each group.\n\nImplementing this solution in Python code will require some knowledge of data manipulation and algorithm design. \n\nThis is a complex problem that may require advanced techniques such as graph theory or linear programming to solve optimally. It's also worth noting that this problem is similar to the well-known 'minimum vertex cover' problem in graph theory, which is a NP-complete problem. This means that there is no known algorithm that can solve all instances of the problem quickly (in \"polynomial time\"). For ten employees this can be still solved with a computer, but as the number of employees (or projects) grows, it quickly becomes infeasible to solve exactly. \n\nSo please note that the Python code may not be able to handle much larger inputs or guarantee the optimal solution in all cases.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
