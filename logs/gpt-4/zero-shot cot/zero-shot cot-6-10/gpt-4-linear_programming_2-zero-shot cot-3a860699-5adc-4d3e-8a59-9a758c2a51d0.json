{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: This is your lucky day. You have just won a $20,000 prize. You are setting aside $8,000 for taxes and partying expenses, but you have decided to invest the other $12,000. Upon hearing this news, two different friends have offered you an opportunity to become a partner in two different entrepreneurial ventures, one planned by each friend. In both cases, this investment would involve expending some of your time next summer as well as putting up cash. Becoming a full partner in the first friend\u2019s venture would require an investment of $10,000 and 400 hours, and your estimated profit (ignoring the value of your time) would be $9,000. The corresponding figures for the second friend\u2019s venture are $8,000 and 500 hours, with an estimated profit to you of $9,000. However, both friends are flexible and would allow you to come in at any fraction of a full partnership you would like. If you choose a fraction of a full partnership, all the above figures given for a full partnership (money investment, time investment, and your profit) would be multiplied by this same fraction. Because you were looking for an interesting summer job anyway (maximum of 600 hours), you have decided to participate in one or both friends\u2019 ventures in whichever combination would maximize your total estimated profit. You now need to solve the problem of finding the best combination.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break down the problem.\n\n1. We are given a total of $12,000 and 600 hours to invest.\n\n2. We have two options for investment, each with a different cost and time requirement, but the same potential profit.\n\n3. Since both opportunities offer to adjust the partnership share, we can invest in either of them or both of them in any proportion, provided we don't exceed our resources.\n\n4. Our objective is to maximize the total profit.\n\nThis is a classic problem of linear programming, where we want to maximize or minimize an objective function subject to some constraints. \n\nLet's denote:\n\n- X as a fraction of a full partnership in the first friend's venture.\n- Y as a fraction of a full partnership in the second friend's venture.\n\nOur objective function (the total profit) becomes:\n\nObjective Function: Maximize P = 9000X + 9000Y\n\nSubject to the following constraints:\n\n- Money Constraint: 10000X + 8000Y <= 12000\n- Time Constraint: 400X + 500Y <= 600\n- Non-negativity Constraint: X, Y >= 0\n\nNow we can solve these equations using a linear programming solver. Python has a library for linear programming called scipy.optimize. We can use the linprog function from this library to solve the problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
