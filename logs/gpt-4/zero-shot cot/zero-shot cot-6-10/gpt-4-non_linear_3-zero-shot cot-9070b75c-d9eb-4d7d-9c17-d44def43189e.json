Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "Given that Ann has $50,000 to invest and she is looking for a return of 15%, we need to find the minimum amount she needs to invest to achieve this return. \n\nFirst, we need to understand that the return on investment is calculated by the formula:\n\nReturn on Investment = (Expected Return / Total Investment) * 100%\n\nSince we are dealing with two stocks, the total expected return would be the sum of the expected returns from both stocks. The same goes for the total investment, which would be the sum of the investments in both stocks.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nx1 = the amount of money invested in stock 1 (in units of 1,000 dollars)\nx2 = the amount of money invested in stock 2 (in units of 1,000 dollars)\n\nThe return from each stock is respectively:\n\nReturn 1 = x1 * (Expected Return per block of stock 1) = x1 * 5\nReturn 2 = x2 * (Expected Return per block of stock 2) = x2 * 10\n\nThe total expected return is:\n\nTotal Return = Return 1 + Return 2 = x1 * 5 + x2 * 10\n\nAnd the total investment is:\n\nTotal Investment = x1 + x2\n\nWe are looking for the minimum investment needed to achieve a return of 15%. So, we need to solve the following inequality:\n\nTotal Return / Total Investment >= 15%\n\nLet's substitute the expressions for Total Return and Total Investment:\n\nx1 * 5 + x2 * 10 / x1 + x2 >= 15%\n\nThis can be solved using a linear programming method.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
