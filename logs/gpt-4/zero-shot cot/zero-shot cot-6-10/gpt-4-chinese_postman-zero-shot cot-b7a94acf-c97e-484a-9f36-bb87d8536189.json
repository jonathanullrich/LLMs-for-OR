He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": "Okay, let's go step by step.\n\n1. Draw a graph with the given points and streets (edges). Assign the length of each street to the corresponding edge.\n\n2. This problem is a variation of the \"Traveling Salesman Problem\" (TSP), which is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It focuses on optimization. In this problem, we have to find a shortest possible route that the postman can take to cover all streets at least once and return to the starting point.\n\n3. In a standard TSP, the postman (or 'salesman') doesn't revisit streets and doesn't have to pass each street at least once. But in this problem, the postman can revisit streets and also has to pass each street at least once. This is a variation of TSP known as the \"Route Inspection\" or \"Chinese Postman Problem\".\n\n4. The Chinese Postman Problem has a well-known solution. We first need to find all 'odd' vertices (vertices connected to an odd number of edges). In this graph, vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are connected to 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1 edges respectively. So, the odd vertices are B, D, E, F, G.\n\n5. Then, we need to find the shortest path between all pairs of these odd vertices. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Floyd Warshall algorithm for this.\n\n6. After getting the shortest distances, we find the minimum-weight perfect matching in the complete graph of odd vertices. This can be done using the Blossom algorithm.\n\n7. We then combine this matching with the original graph to form an Eulerian graph (a graph with a path that visits every edge exactly once).\n\n8. Finally, we find an Eulerian circuit in this graph. This will be the shortest possible route that the postman can take.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is dominated by the step of finding the minimum-weight perfect matching, which is O(n^3) where n is the number of vertices. So, it can handle graphs with up to about 100 vertices in a reasonable amount of time. This problem has only 8 vertices, so it can be easily solved. \n\nNow, let's implement this algorithm in Python. We first need to represent the graph in Python. We can use a list of lists (adjacency matrix) or a dictionary of dictionaries (adjacency list) for this. Let's use an adjacency list because it's more efficient for sparse graphs like this one. We represent it as a dictionary where the keys are the vertices and the values are dictionaries with the neighbors as keys and the lengths as values:\n\n```\ngraph = {\n    'A': {'B': 2, 'C': 2},\n    'B': {'A': 2, 'C': 3, 'D': 4},\n    'C': {'A': 2, 'B': 3},\n    'D': {'B': 4, 'E': 3, 'F': 4},\n    'E': {'D': 3, 'F': 9, 'G': 3},\n    'F': {'D': 4, 'E': 9, 'G': 5},\n    'G': {'E': 3, 'F': 5, 'H': 3},\n    'H': {'G': 3}\n}\n```\n\nWe also need to represent the set of odd vertices. We can use a list for this:\n\n```\nodd_vertices = ['B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\n```\n\nNow, let's implement the algorithm. We first need to find the shortest distances between all pairs of odd vertices. We can use the Floyd Warshall algorithm for this. We initialize a matrix with infinity for all pairs of vertices, except the diagonal which is 0:\n\n```\ndistances = [[float('inf') if i != j else 0 for j in range(len(odd_vertices))] for i in range(len(odd_vertices))]\n```\n\nThen, we update the distances with the actual distances in the graph:\n\n```\nfor i in range(len(odd_vertices)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(odd_vertices)):\n        distances[i][j] = distances[j][i] = dijkstra(graph, odd_vertices[i], odd_vertices[j])\n```\n\nHere, `dijkstra(graph, source, target)` is a function that finds the shortest distance between `source` and `target` in `graph` using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nAfter getting the distances, we find the minimum-weight perfect matching. This can be done using the Blossom algorithm. We first need to represent the complete graph of odd vertices. We can use a list of lists (adjacency matrix) for this:\n\n```\nmatching_graph = [[0 if i == j else distances[i][j] for j in range(len(odd_vertices))] for i in range(len(odd_vertices))]\n```\n\nThen, we find the matching:\n\n```\nmatching = blossom(matching_graph)\n```\n\nHere, `blossom(graph)` is a function that finds a minimum-weight perfect matching in `graph` using the Blossom algorithm.\n\nWe then combine this matching with the original graph to form an Eulerian graph. This can be done by adding an edge between each pair of vertices in the matching:\n\n```\nfor i, j in matching:\n    graph[odd_vertices[i]][odd_vertices[j]] = graph[odd_vertices[j]][odd_vertices[i]] = distances[i][j]\n```\n\nFinally, we find an Eulerian circuit in this graph. This can be done using Hierholzer's algorithm. We start from 'A' and follow edges until we come back to 'A'. We then repeat the process for any vertices we haven't visited yet:\n\n```\ncircuit = eulerian_circuit(graph, 'A')\n```\n\nHere, `eulerian_circuit(graph, source)` is a function that finds an Eulerian circuit in `graph` starting from `source` using Hierholzer's algorithm.\n\nThe circuit is a list of vertices. We can calculate the total length of the circuit by summing up the lengths of the edges:\n\n```\nlength = sum(graph[circuit[i]][circuit[i+1]] for i in range(len(circuit)-1))\n```\n\nThis is the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
