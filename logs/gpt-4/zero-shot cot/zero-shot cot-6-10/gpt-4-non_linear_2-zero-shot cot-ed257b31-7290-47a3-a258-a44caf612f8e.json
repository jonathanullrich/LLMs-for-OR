The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to create a mathematical model to represent the problem. In this case, we want to minimize the total distance travelled by all the flights, so we'll use linear programming.\n\nThe objective function will be:\n\nf(x, y) = 40*sqrt((x-40)^2 + (y-200)^2) + 10*sqrt((x-160)^2 + (y-210)^2) + 20*sqrt((x-250)^2 + (y-160)^2) + 30*sqrt((x-220)^2 + (y-80)^2) + 20*sqrt((x-100)^2 + (y-40)^2) + 10*sqrt((x-30)^2 + (y-100)^2)\n\nThe constraints will be:\n\nx + y >= 250 (swamp area)\n\n(x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 >= 400 (lake area)\n\nx, y >= 0\n\nWe need to solve this problem for the values of x and y that minimize f(x, y). This is a non-linear programming problem. We can solve this using the scipy.optimize.minimize function.\n\nLet's write the Python code.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
