Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we need to understand that the tax revenue is the product of the number of cigarettes sold and the tax per cigarette.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- f(t) = 53 - 100*(t/100) as the average daily consumption per smoker (in cigarettes)\n- p = 15 cents as the price per cigarette\n- t as the tax rate.\n\nThe tax per cigarette is t*p/100 and the total tax revenue R(t) is f(t) * t * p / 100.\n\nOur task now is to find the value of t that maximizes R(t).\n\nThis can be done by differentiating R(t) and finding where the derivative is 0. Given that R(t) is a quadratic function, its maximum will be at the vertex of the parabola, which can be found by the formula -b/2a (where a and b are the coefficients of t^2 and t in the polynomial).\n\nBut since we are dealing with a discrete number of cigarettes, we should also check the values of t where f(t) is an integer because the derivative might not give us an integer number of cigarettes.\n\nWe can write a Python script to solve this problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
