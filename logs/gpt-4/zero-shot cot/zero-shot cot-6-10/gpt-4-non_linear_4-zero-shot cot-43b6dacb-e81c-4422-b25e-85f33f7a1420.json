Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "First, you need to determine the maximum amount of units you can produce for each product per hour. Given that you can only produce two units per hour in total, and the profit for each product decreases as you produce more units, you need to find the balance between producing more units of the more profitable product and not exceeding the total production capacity.\n\nSecond, you need to calculate the profit for each product at the determined production rate. The profit function for each product is given, so you just need to plug in the production rate.\n\nFinally, you need to add up the profits from both products to get the total profit. \n\nSince this problem involves optimization, it can be solved using calculus or optimization algorithms. \n\nBut without the constraints or the objective function to maximize or minimize, we cannot solve this problem.
