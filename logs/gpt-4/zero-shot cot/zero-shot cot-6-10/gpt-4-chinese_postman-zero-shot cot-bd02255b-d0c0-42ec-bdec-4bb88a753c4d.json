He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we can note that this problem is a variant of the Chinese Postman Problem, also known as the Postman Tour or Route Inspection Problem. The goal is to find the shortest closed path (or circuit) that visits every edge of a (connected) undirected graph.\n\nTo start we need to identify all the nodes that have an odd degree (odd number of edges coming out of them). These are the nodes that the postman would have to return to in order to cover all streets at least once, since every time he enters a node through one street, he must leave it through another. \n\nIn your problem, the nodes with an odd degree are: B, D, E, F, G, H. \n\nThen we have to find the shortest paths between all pairs of these nodes. This can be done using Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall algorithm. We create a complete graph where the nodes are the nodes with odd degree and the weight of an edge between two nodes is the shortest path between them in the original graph. \n\nFinding the shortest route in this new graph that visits all nodes exactly once and returns to the starting node is a well-known problem called the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is NP-hard, but since we have only 6 nodes, it can be solved in reasonable time by brute force or an algorithm like the Held-Karp algorithm. \n\nFinally, the shortest route to walk through all the streets is the sum of the lengths of all edges in the original graph and the shortest route in the new graph. \n\nThe actual calculation would require writing a program or script using a programming language such as Python. Python has libraries such as NetworkX that can handle graphs and algorithms for shortest path and TSP.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
