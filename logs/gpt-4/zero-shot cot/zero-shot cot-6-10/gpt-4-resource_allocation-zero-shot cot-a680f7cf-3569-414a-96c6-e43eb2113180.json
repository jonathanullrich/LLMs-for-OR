{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break it down:\n\n1) If Luxor Travel rents each week separately, the cost is determined by the number of cars rented each week multiplied by the rental fee, plus the transaction fee for each week. \n\n2) If Luxor Travel decides to keep the cars for an additional week, the cost is determined by the highest number of cars needed for two consecutive weeks multiplied by the rental fee, plus the transaction fee for the first week.\n\n3) To get the minimum cost, Luxor Travel should compare the cost of renting each week separately with the cost of keeping the cars for an additional week, and choose the cheaper option.\n\nNow let's translate this into Python code.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
