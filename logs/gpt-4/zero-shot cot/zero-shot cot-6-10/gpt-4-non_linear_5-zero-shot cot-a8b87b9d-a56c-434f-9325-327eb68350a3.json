{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The MFG Corporation is planning to produce and market three different products. Let x1, x2, and x3 denote the number of units of the three respective products to be produced. The preliminary estimates of their potential profitability are as follows. For the first 15 units produced of Product 1, the unit profit would be approximately $360. The unit profit would be only $30 for any additional units of Product 1. For the first 20 units produced of Product 2, the unit profit is estimated at $240. The unit profit would be $120 for each of the next 20 units and $90 for any additional units. For the first 20 units of Product 3, the unit profit would be $450. The unit profit would be $300 for each of the next 10 units and $180 for any additional units. Certain limitations on the use of needed resources impose the following constraints on the production of the three products: x1 + x2 + x3 <= 60, 3*x1 + 2*x2 <= 200, x1 + 2*x3 <= 70. Management wants to know what values of x1, x2 and x3 should be chosen to maximize the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, here are the steps in the process:\n\n1. Define the decision variables: In this case, the decision variables are x1, x2, and x3 which represent the number of units of each product to be produced.\n\n2. Define the objective function: The objective function is the total profit from producing the products. This is a function of the decision variables and it is what the company wants to maximize.\n\n3. Define the constraints: The constraints are the limitations on the production of the products. These are functions of the decision variables and they limit the possible solutions to the problem.\n\n4. Solve the problem: Use an optimization algorithm to find the values of the decision variables that maximize the objective function while satisfying the constraints.\n\n5. Interpret the solution: The solution is the values of the decision variables that maximize the total profit. These are the quantities of each product that the company should produce.\n\nHere is the pseudocode for the problem:\n\n1. Initialize the decision variables x1, x2, and x3.\n2. Define the objective function as the sum of the profits from each product.\n3. Define the constraints as the sum of the products less than or equal to the given limits.\n4. Use an optimization algorithm to solve the problem.\n5. The solution is the values of x1, x2, and x3 that maximize the total profit.\n\nNow, let's write the python code for the problem. We will use the `scipy.optimize` library to solve the problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
