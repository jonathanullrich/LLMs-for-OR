Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we know that the total number of units produced cannot exceed 2 per hour. So, we have R1 + R2 <= 2.\n\nSecondly, we know the profit functions for each product, which are $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 and $300*R2 - $100*R2^2 respectively.\n\nTo maximize the total profit, we can add these two functions together and then find the maximum value of the resulting function.\n\nBut since we are dealing with decreasing marginal returns, it means the profit functions are concave down, which means the maximum value will occur at either end of the feasible region (0 <= R1, R2 <= 2), or at a point where the derivative equals zero.\n\nWe can calculate these points and compare the profit at these points to find the maximum value.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
