{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "We can solve this problem using mathematical programming. We want to maximize Ann's return subject to her risk tolerance. This can be translated into an optimization problem where we maximize the expected return (5 * x1 + 10 * x2) subject to a constraint on the variance of the portfolio (4 * x1^2 + 100 * x2^2 + 10 * x1 * x2 <= Ann's risk tolerance).\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. We need to find the investment amount in each stock (x1 and x2) that maximizes Ann's return subject to her risk tolerance.\n\n2. We can use the SciPy library in Python to solve the optimization problem. We need to define the objective function (negative expected return), the constraint (variance <= Ann's risk tolerance), and the bounds for the decision variables (x1 and x2).\n\n3. We then solve the optimization problem using the minimize function from the SciPy library. \n\n4. The solution of the optimization problem gives us the investment amount in each stock that maximizes Ann's return subject to her risk tolerance. \n\n5. Finally, we calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent. This is done by dividing the total investment amount by the price per block for each stock.\n\nPlease note that we need more information to solve this problem completely. Specifically, we need to know Ann's risk tolerance. Without this information, we cannot determine the optimal investment mix.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
