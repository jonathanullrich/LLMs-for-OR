Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Tom would like 3 pints of home brew today and an additional 4 pints of home brew tomorrow. Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow. Tom wishes to know what his purchases should be to minimize his cost while satisfying his thirst requirements", "examples": null, "output": "Firstly, we can break down the problem into two decision variables:\n\n1. The number of pints Tom will buy from Dick today (let's call it x1).\n2. The number of pints Tom will buy from Harry today (let's call it x2).\n\nWe know that x1 + x2 = 3 (because Tom wants to buy 3 pints today).\n\nSimilarly, for tomorrow, let's define:\n\n3. The number of pints Tom will buy from Dick tomorrow (let's call it y1).\n4. The number of pints Tom will buy from Harry tomorrow (let's call it y2).\n\nWe know that y1 + y2 = 4 (because Tom wants to buy 4 pints tomorrow).\n\nNow, the total cost of buying x1 pints from Dick today would be 3x1 dollars, and from Harry, it would be 2.9x2 dollars. Similarly, for tomorrow, the cost would be 2.7y1 dollars from Dick and 2.8y2 dollars from Harry.\n\nSo, the total cost (which Tom wants to minimize) can be represented as:\n\nCost = 3x1 + 2.9x2 + 2.7y1 + 2.8y2.\n\nHowever, we have some constraints:\n\n1. x1 + y1 \u2264 5 (Because Dick can sell a maximum of 5 pints).\n2. x2 + y2 \u2264 4 (Because Harry can sell a maximum of 4 pints).\n\nNow, we can solve this as a linear programming problem. Here's how you can do it in Python using the SciPy library's optimize.linprog function:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import linprog\n\nc = [3, 2.9, 2.7, 2.8]  # Coefficients for the objective function\nA = [[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]  # Coefficients for the inequality constraints\nb = [5, 4]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\nx0_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for x1\nx1_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for x2\nx2_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for y1\nx3_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for y2\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds, x2_bounds, x3_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = res.fun\n```\n\nThis code will give you the minimum cost that Tom needs to pay to satisfy his thirst requirements. The values of x1, x2, y1, and y2 that give the minimum cost can be obtained from `res.x`.", "code": "from scipy.optimize import linprog\n\nc = [3, 2.9, 2.7, 2.8]  # Coefficients for the objective function\nA = [[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]  # Coefficients for the inequality constraints\nb = [5, 4]  # Right-hand side of the inequality constraints\nx0_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for x1\nx1_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for x2\nx2_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for y1\nx3_bounds = (0, None)  # Bounds for y2\n\nres = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds, x2_bounds, x3_bounds], method='highs')\n\nsolution = res.fun", "solution": 0.0}
