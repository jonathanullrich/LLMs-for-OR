{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The WorldLight Company produces two light fixtures (products 1 and 2) that require both metal frame parts and electrical components. Management wants to determine how many units of each product to produce so as to maximize profit. For each unit of product 1, 1 unit of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. For each unit of product 2, 3 units of frame parts and 2 units of electrical components are required. The company has 200 units of frame parts and 300 units of electrical components. Each unit of product 1 gives a profit of $1, and each unit of product 2, up to 60 units, gives a profit of $2. Any excess over 60 units of product 2 brings no profit, so such an excess has been ruled out. What is the resulting total profit?", "examples": null, "output": "First, we must recognize this is a linear programming problem. We have constraints on resources (frame parts and electrical components) and we want to maximize profit.\n\nHere is how we can set up the problem:\n\n- Let x1 and x2 be the number of units produced for product 1 and product 2 respectively.\n- Our objective is to maximize profit, which is given by the equation: profit = x1 + 2*x2\n- We also know that we have constraints on the resources we can use. These are:\n  - Frame parts: x1 + 3*x2 <= 200\n  - Electrical components: 2*x1 + 2*x2 <= 300\n  - We also know that we can't produce more than 60 units of product 2 for profit, so x2 <= 60\n  - And finally, we can't produce a negative number of units, so x1 >= 0 and x2 >= 0\n\nWe can solve this problem using linear programming. Python has a library called scipy that we can use for this. Here is how we can code it:", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
