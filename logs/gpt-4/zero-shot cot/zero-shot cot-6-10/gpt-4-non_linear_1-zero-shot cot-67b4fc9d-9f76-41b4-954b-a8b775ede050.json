Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "1. First, we need to understand that the tax revenue is a product of the tax rate, the price per cigarette and the average daily consumption per smoker. So, we can write it as a function: Revenue = Tax rate * Price per cigarette * Average daily consumption.\n\n2. The tax rate is a percentage, so we should divide it by 100 when calculating the revenue.\n\n3. The average daily consumption per smoker is given by the function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). We should substitute this in the Revenue function.\n\n4. We are asked to find the tax rate that maximizes the revenue. This is an optimization problem. We can solve it using calculus by finding the derivative of the Revenue function and setting it equal to zero.\n\n5. The revenue function is a quadratic function. The maximum value of a quadratic function occurs at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by -b/(2a).\n\n6. In the case of the Revenue function, a is -15 (the coefficient of t^2), b is 15*53 (the coefficient of t) and c is 0 (the constant term).\n\n7. Therefore, the tax rate that maximizes the revenue is given by -b/(2a) = -[15*53]/[2*(-15)] = 53/2 = 26.5%.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
