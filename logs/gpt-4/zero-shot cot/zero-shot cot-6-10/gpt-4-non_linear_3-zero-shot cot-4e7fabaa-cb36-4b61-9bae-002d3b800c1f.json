Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that Ann has $50,000 to invest in two types of stocks. The price per block for stock 1 is 20 and for stock 2 is 30. We also know that the expected return for stock 1 is 5 and for stock 2 is 10.\n\nThe problem is asking us to calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent. This means we need to find the proportion of the investment that should go into each stock in order to minimize the risk (variance) and achieve the desired return.\n\nWe can use the following formulas:\n\nExpected Return = w1*r1 + w2*r2\nVariance = w1^2*v1 + w2^2*v2 + 2*w1*w2*cov12\n\nWhere:\n- w1, w2 are the weights (proportions) of the investment in stock 1 and stock 2 respectively.\n- r1, r2 are the expected returns for stock 1 and stock 2 respectively.\n- v1, v2 are the variances of the returns for stock 1 and stock 2 respectively.\n- cov12 is the covariance of the returns of stock 1 and stock 2.\n\nGiven that we want to minimize the variance and achieve a return of 15 percent, we can set up the following optimization problem:\n\nMinimize: w1^2*v1 + w2^2*v2 + 2*w1*w2*cov12\nSubject to: w1*r1 + w2*r2 = 15\n            w1 + w2 = 1\n            w1, w2 >= 0\n\nWe can solve this optimization problem using a Python library such as scipy or cvxpy.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
