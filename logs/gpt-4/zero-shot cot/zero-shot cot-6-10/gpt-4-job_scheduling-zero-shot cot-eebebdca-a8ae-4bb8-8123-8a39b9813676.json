Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?", "examples": null, "output": "Sure.\n\n1. Job 2 must be processed first because it has the earliest deadline. This will take 4 days.\n2. Then, Job 1 should be processed because it has the second earliest deadline. This will take another 6 days.\n3. After that, Job 3 should be processed because it has the third earliest deadline. This will take another 5 days.\n4. Finally, Job 4 should be processed. This will take another 8 days.\n\nSo the minimum time needed to process all jobs is the sum of these processing times.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
