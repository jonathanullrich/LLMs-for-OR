Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow.

Tom's brew requirements: x1 + y1 >= 3 (for today) and x2 + y2 >= 4 (for tomorrow)\n2. Dick's availability: x1 + x2 <= 5\n3. Harry's availability: y1 + y2 <= 4\n\nLastly, let's define the objective function that Tom wishes to minimize: 3x1 + 2.7x2 + 2.9y1 + 2.8y2\n\nWe can use the scipy.optimize library in Python to solve this linear programming problem.
