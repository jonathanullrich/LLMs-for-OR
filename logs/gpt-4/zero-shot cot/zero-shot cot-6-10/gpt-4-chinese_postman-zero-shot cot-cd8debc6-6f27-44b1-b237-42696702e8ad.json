He can walk through a street multiple times and he can do so in both directions. The streets connecting two points and their respective length is: A-B (length 2), A-C (length 2), B-C (length 3), B-D (length 4), D-E (length 3), D-F (length 4), E-F (length 9), E-G (length 3), F-G (length 5), G-H (length 3). Find the route with the minimal length to walk through all the streets.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to find all the odd-degree nodes, since the postman's walk is an Eulerian path, which requires all nodes have even degree. The only exception is the starting and ending node, which can have odd degree. In this case, since the postman starts and ends at point A, we only need to care about the degree of other points. \n\n1. Point A connects to B and C, so degree 2 (even)\n2. Point B connects to A, C, D, so degree 3 (odd)\n3. Point C connects to A and B, so degree 2 (even)\n4. Point D connects to B, E, F, so degree 3 (odd)\n5. Point E connects to D, F, G, so degree 3 (odd)\n6. Point F connects to D, E, G, so degree 3 (odd)\n7. Point G connects to E, F, H, so degree 3 (odd)\n8. Point H connects to G, so degree 1 (odd)\n\nFrom this, we know that points B, D, E, F, G, H have odd degree. Since the postman starts and ends at A, we need to make two of the odd-degree points to have even degree. This can be done by duplicating the shortest edge connecting any two odd-degree points. Let's find out which edge that would be.\n\n1. B-D: 4\n2. B-E: 7 (B-D + D-E)\n3. B-F: 8 (B-D + D-F)\n4. B-G: 10 (B-D + D-E + E-G)\n5. B-H: 13 (B-D + D-E + E-G + G-H)\n6. D-E: 3\n7. D-F: 4\n8. D-G: 6 (D-E + E-G)\n9. D-H: 9 (D-E + E-G + G-H)\n10. E-F: 9\n11. E-G: 3\n12. E-H: 6 (E-G + G-H)\n13. F-G: 5\n14. F-H: 8 (F-G + G-H)\n15. G-H: 3\n\nThe shortest edge is D-E, with a length of 3. So we duplicate this edge, and now the total length of the path is the sum of all original edge lengths plus the length of the duplicated edge.\n\nThe route with the minimal length is then A-B-C-B-D-E-D-F-E-G-H-G-F-D-B-A, with a total length of 2+3+2+4+3+4+3+3+3+5+3+5+4+2 = 46. This is the solution to the problem.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
