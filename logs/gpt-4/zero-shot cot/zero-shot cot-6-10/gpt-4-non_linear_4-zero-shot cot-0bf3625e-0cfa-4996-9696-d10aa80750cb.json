Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we know that the total production rate of both products cannot exceed two units per hour, so we have a constraint: R1 + R2 \u2264 2.\n\nSecond, the profit per hour for each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. We need to find the optimal production rates R1 and R2 that maximize the total profit.\n\nThe total profit, P, can be calculated as the sum of the profits from both products, which is: P = ($200*R1 - $100*R1^2) + ($300*R2 - $100*R2^2).\n\nTo find the optimal R1 and R2, we need to solve this maximization problem under the given constraint. Because the profit functions are quadratic, we can use calculus to find the maximum. We'll take the derivative of the profit function with respect to each production rate, set it equal to zero, and solve for the production rate. This will give us the production rates that maximize profit.\n\nBut this can also be solved using python using optimization libraries. \n\nLet's write a python code snippet for this using scipy's optimization library.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
