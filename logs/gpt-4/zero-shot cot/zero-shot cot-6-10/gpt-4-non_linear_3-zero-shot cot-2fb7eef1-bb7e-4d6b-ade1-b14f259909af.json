Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "Given that the expected return per block for Stock 1 is 5 and for Stock 2 is 10, and the prices per block are 20 for Stock 1 and 30 for Stock 2, we can calculate the expected return per dollar invested in each stock.\n\nExpected return per dollar for Stock 1 = 5/20 = 0.25\nExpected return per dollar for Stock 2 = 10/30 = 0.33\n\nGiven that Ann wants a 15% return on her investment, let's denote the amount of money she invests in Stock 1 as x and Stock 2 as y. Therefore, we have the following equation:\n\n0.25x + 0.33y = 0.15 * (x + y)\n\nWe also know that Ann has a total of $50,000 to invest, which gives us another equation:\n\nx + y = 50,000\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find the values of x and y, which represent the amount of money Ann needs to invest in Stock 1 and Stock 2 respectively.\n\nFinally, we need to find the minimum of these two values as Ann desires to minimize her risk. This can be done by calculating the variance of the return on each investment and choosing the one with the lower variance.\n\nVariance of return for Stock 1 = (4/20^2) * x^2\nVariance of return for Stock 2 = (100/30^2) * y^2\nCovariance of return = 5/20*30 * xy\n\nTherefore, the total risk, as measured by the variance, is given by:\n\nRisk = Variance of return for Stock 1 + Variance of return for Stock 2 + 2 * Covariance of return\n\nWe then need to minimize this risk while ensuring that the total return is at least 15%. This is a quadratic optimization problem that can be solved using Python and a library such as cvxpy.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
