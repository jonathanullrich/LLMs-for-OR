Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure. Here's how you can approach this problem:\n\n1. First, we need to identify our decision variables. In this case, they are the number of blocks of each stock Ann should buy. Let's denote these as x1 and x2. \n\n2. Next, we need to set up our objective function. Since Ann wants to minimize her risk, our objective function will be the variance of her portfolio. This can be calculated as follows: \n\n        variance = (4*x1^2) + (100*x2^2) + (2*5*x1*x2)\n\n3. Then, we have to consider the constraints. Ann has a total of $50,000 to invest, and the price per block is $20,000 for stock 1 and $30,000 for stock 2. This gives us the following constraint: \n\n        20*x1 + 30*x2 <= 50\n\n    Also, Ann wants a return of at least 15%, so we have:\n\n        5*x1 + 10*x2 >= 15\n\n4. Finally, we can use a quadratic programming solver to solve this problem. Python has several libraries that can handle quadratic programming, such as CVXOPT and SciPy.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
