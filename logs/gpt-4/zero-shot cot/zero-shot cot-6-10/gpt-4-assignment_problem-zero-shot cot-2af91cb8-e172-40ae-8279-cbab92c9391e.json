{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The coach of an age group swim team needs to assign swimmers to a 200-yard medley relay team to send to the Junior Olympics. Since most of his best swimmers are very fast in more than one stroke, it is not clear which swimmer should be assigned to each of the four strokes. The five fastest swimmers and the best times (in seconds) they have achieved in each of the strokes (for 50 yards) are for Backstroke: Carl (37.7), Chris (32.9), David (33.8), Tony (37.0), Ken (35.4); for Breaststroke: Carl (43.4), Chris (33.1), David (42.2), Tony (34.7), Ken (41.8); for Butterfly: Carl (33.3), Chris (28.5), David (38.9), Tony (30.4), Ken (33.6); for Freestyle: Carl (29.2), Chris (26.4), David (29.6), Tony (28.5), Ken (31.1). The coach wishes to determine how to assign four swimmers to the four different strokes to minimize the sum of the corresponding best times. Find the minimum time spend.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to determine the problem type. This is an assignment problem where we have multiple tasks and multiple agents, and we need to find the optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost. Here, the tasks are the four swimming strokes, the agents are the five swimmers, and the cost is the best time each swimmer can achieve in each stroke.\n\nSecond, we can use the Hungarian algorithm (also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm) to solve this problem. This algorithm is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time. \n\nNow, let's write the Python code. We will use the scipy library, which provides a function to solve assignment problems using the Hungarian algorithm.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
