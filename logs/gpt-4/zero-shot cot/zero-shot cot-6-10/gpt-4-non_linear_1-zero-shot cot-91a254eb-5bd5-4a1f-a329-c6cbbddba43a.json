Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "First, let's define the function to calculate the average daily consumption per smoker. We know it is given by the function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). \n\nNext, the tax revenue can be calculated as the number of cigarettes sold times the tax per cigarette. The number of cigarettes sold can be calculated as the average daily consumption per smoker times the number of smokers. In this problem, we can assume that the number of smokers is constant, so we can ignore it for the purpose of this calculation. The tax per cigarette is given by the tax rate times the base price per cigarette.\n\nFinally, we need to find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. To do this, we can use a mathematical optimization technique. For example, we can use a method called \"gradient ascent\", which starts with an initial guess and iteratively improves it by moving in the direction that increases the tax revenue.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\nbase_price = 0.15\nf = lambda t: 53 - 100*(t/100)\nrevenue = lambda t: -t * base_price * f(t)  # we minimize the negative revenue to perform maximization\n\nresult = minimize(revenue, 0, bounds=[(0, 100)])  # the tax rate must be between 0 and 100\nsolution = result.x[0]\n```\n\nIn the code above, we use the `minimize` function from the `scipy.optimize` module. We pass to it the `revenue` function we want to maximize, an initial guess for the tax rate (0 in this case), and the bounds for the tax rate. The `minimize` function returns an object that contains the result of the optimization. The optimal tax rate can be obtained using `result.x[0]`. \n\nThe solution will be the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue. \n\n(Note: In real-world scenarios, the number of smokers could change with the tax rate, the relationship between tax rate and consumption might not be linear, and there could be other factors to consider. This is a simplified model for illustrative purposes.)", "code": "import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\nbase_price = 0.15\nf = lambda t: 53 - 100*(t/100)\nrevenue = lambda t: -t * base_price * f(t)  # we minimize the negative revenue to perform maximization\n\nresult = minimize(revenue, 0, bounds=[(0, 100)])  # the tax rate must be between 0 and 100\nsolution = result.x[0]", "solution": 26.500006485436433}
