The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.", "examples": null, "output": "First, we need to define the conditions for the swamp and lake areas. We can't build the airfield in these regions.\n\nNext, we should calculate the distance between each airfield and every possible location for the new airfield. The distance formula is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). We multiply this distance by the number of flights to get the total flight distance for each airfield.\n\nFinally, we need to find the location that minimizes the total flight distance for all airfields. This is our objective function.\n\nLet's start coding:", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
