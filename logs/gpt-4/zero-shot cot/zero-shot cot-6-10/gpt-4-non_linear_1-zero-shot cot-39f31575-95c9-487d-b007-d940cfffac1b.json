{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Taxation can be used as an instrument to curb the demand for cigarettes. Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "First, let's denote the quantity of cigarettes consumed per day as Q, the amount of tax collected per cigarette as T, and the total revenue as R. \n\nWe have Q = 53 - 100*(t/100) which is the same as Q = 53 - t. The amount of tax collected per cigarette is T = 15 cents * t/100 and the total tax revenue is R = Q * T. \n\nWe want to maximize R, which is a function of t. We can differentiate R with respect to t, set it equal to 0, and solve for t to find the tax rate that will maximize the tax revenue. \n\nLet's implement this in Python.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
