Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The optimum location is sought for an airfield from which the six airfields A to F can be approached. The optimum location is the airfield for which the sum of the daily flight kilometers is minimal. The distance is assumed to be as the crow flies. The coordinates (x, y) and the number of flights from the airfields are as follows: A (40, 200) 40 flights, B (160, 210) 10 flights, C (250, 160) 20 flights, D (220, 80) 30 flights, E (100, 40) 20 flights, F (30, 100) 10 flights. A swamp area defined by the condition x + y >= 250 and a lake whose area is described by the condition (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 <= 400 are not suitable for the airfield. Determine the objective function value of the optimal location.", "examples": null, "output": "Absolutely, here is how you can approach this:\n\n1. First, define the objective function. This function calculates the sum of the daily flight kilometers from each airfield to a given location (x, y). The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated using the formula sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2). The total distance is then multiplied by the number of flights.\n\n2. Next, define the constraints. The location of the airfield should not be in the swamp or the lake. This means that x + y < 250 and (x - 100)^2 + (y - 100)^2 > 400.\n\n3. Now, you need to find the location (x, y) that minimizes the objective function subject to the constraints. This can be done using an optimization algorithm. Python has several libraries for optimization, one of them is SciPy which provides the function minimize for this purpose.\n\n4. Finally, calculate the value of the objective function at the optimal location. This is the minimal sum of the daily flight kilometers.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python code.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
