Suppose that, for a tax rate t, the average daily consumption per smoker follows the linear function f = 53 - 100*(t/100). If the tax rate is set high, demand will drop, and the tax revenue will drop as well. For the purpose of taxation, the base price per cigarette is 15 cents. Determine the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue.", "examples": null, "output": "Sure, we can break down the problem into several steps. \n\n1. First, we need to understand the relationship between tax rate, cigarette consumption and tax revenue. According to the problem statement, the daily consumption of cigarettes per smoker is a linear function of the tax rate: f = 53 - 100*(t/100). This means that as the tax rate increases, the average daily consumption decreases. \n\n2. The tax revenue is the product of tax rate, base price and the number of cigarettes consumed. Therefore, the tax revenue function R can be expressed as: R = t * 0.15 * f. \n\n3. To find the tax rate that maximizes the tax revenue, we need to find the maximum of the tax revenue function. This can be done by setting the derivative of the function to zero and solving for t. \n\n4. If the derivative is positive, the function is increasing, and if the derivative is negative, the function is decreasing. The maximum point is where the function changes from increasing to decreasing, i.e., where the derivative is zero.\n\n5. We can solve this problem by using Python. We can define the tax revenue function and its derivative, then use a numerical optimization method to find the maximum. We can use the scipy library for this. \n\n6. Finally, we check the solution to ensure it's within the feasible range for the tax rate.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
