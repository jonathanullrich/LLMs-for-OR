{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.", "examples": null, "output": "First, start by identifying the tasks that each individual can do faster. \n\nFor Marketing, Eve can do it faster (4.5 hours) than Steven (4.9 hours).\n\nFor Cooking, Steven can do it faster (7.2 hours) than Eve (7.8 hours).\n\nFor Dishwashing, Eve can do it faster (3.6 hours) than Steven (4.3 hours).\n\nFor Laundry, Eve can do it faster (2.9 hours) than Steven (3.1 hours).\n\nSo, given these options, we need to find the combination of tasks that would take the least total time.\n\nThe total time would be minimized if Steven does the Cooking and Eve does the remaining three tasks. But this would violate the condition that each should do two tasks. \n\nSo we need to find the combination that respects this condition. There are two options for Eve: (Marketing and Dishwashing) or (Dishwashing and Laundry). In both cases, Steven would do the remaining two tasks. \n\nLet's calculate the total time for each option and choose the one that minimizes this time.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
