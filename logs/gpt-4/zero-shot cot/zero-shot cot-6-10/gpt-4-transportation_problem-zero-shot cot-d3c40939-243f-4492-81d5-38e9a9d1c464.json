Dick is willing to sell a maximum of 5 pints total at a price of $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow. Harry is willing to sell a maximum of 4 pints total at a price of $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow.

Tom needs a total of 7 pints: 3 pints today and 4 pints tomorrow.\n2. He can buy from two sellers: Dick and Harry.\n3. Dick can sell a total of 5 pints: $3.00 per pint today and $2.70 per pint tomorrow.\n4. Harry can sell a total of 4 pints: $2.90 per pint today and $2.80 per pint tomorrow.\n5. Tom's goal is to meet his needs while spending as little money as possible.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Pt_d: Pints Tom buys from Dick today\n- Pt_h: Pints Tom buys from Harry today\n- Pt_d_tomorrow: Pints Tom buys from Dick tomorrow\n- Pt_h_tomorrow: Pints Tom buys from Harry tomorrow\n\nThe objective function to minimize is the total cost:\n\n3*Pt_d + 2.9*Pt_h + 2.7*Pt_d_tomorrow + 2.8*Pt_h_tomorrow\n\nUnder the constraints:\n\nPt_d + Pt_h = 3 (Tom needs 3 pints today)\n\nPt_d_tomorrow + Pt_h_tomorrow = 4 (Tom needs 4 pints tomorrow)\n\nPt_d + Pt_d_tomorrow <= 5 (Dick can only sell 5 pints in total)\n\nPt_h + Pt_h_tomorrow <= 4 (Harry can only sell 4 pints in total)\n\nAll variables are greater than or equal to zero and are integers.\n\nNow, let's write a Python code to solve this linear programming problem. We can use PuLP library in Python to solve it.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
