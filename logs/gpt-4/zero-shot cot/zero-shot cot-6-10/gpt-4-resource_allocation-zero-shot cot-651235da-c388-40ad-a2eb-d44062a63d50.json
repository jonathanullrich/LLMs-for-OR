{"system_prompt": "You are an operations research expert. Write python code to solve the given problem. Assign the final output to a variable 'solution'. Only assign one number.", "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.", "examples": null, "output": "The first step is to determine the total number of weeks Luxor Travel needs the cars. \n\nGiven the demand for rental cars over the next 4 weeks is 7, 4, 7, and 8, the total number of weeks is 7 + 4 + 7 + 8 = 26 weeks.\n\nThe cost of renting a car for a week is $220, so for 26 weeks, the cost would be 26 * $220 = $5720.\n\nHowever, there's also a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. If Luxor Travel chooses to rent the cars every week, they would have to pay this flat fee four times (once for each week), which would add an additional 4 * $500 = $2000 to the cost.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of renting the cars every week would be $5720 + $2000 = $7720.\n\nOn the other hand, if Luxor Travel chooses to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent, they would only have to pay the flat fee once, but would have to pay the weekly rental fee for all 26 weeks. This would cost $5720 + $500 = $6220.\n\nTherefore, the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand is to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. This approach would result in a minimal cost of $6220.", "code": "", "solution": "COMPILE_ERROR"}
