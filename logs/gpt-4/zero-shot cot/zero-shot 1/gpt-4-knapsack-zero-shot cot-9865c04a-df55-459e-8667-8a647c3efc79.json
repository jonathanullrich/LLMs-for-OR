    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A hiker has a 5-ft^3 backpack and needs to decide on the most valuable items to take on the hiking trip. There are three items from which to choose. Their volumes are 2, 3, and 4 ft^3, and the hiker estimates their associated values on a scale from 0 to 100 as 30, 50, and 70, respectively. Find the optimal solution.",

    "output": "Sure, let's break it down:\n\n1. The hiker has a backpack with a limited capacity (5 ft^3).\n2. The hiker has 3 items to choose from, each with different volumes and values.\n3. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the backpack without exceeding the backpack's capacity.\n\nThis is a classic example of a 0/1 Knapsack problem. In these problems, you can either take an item or leave it (you can't take a fraction of an item).\n\nLet's assign the values and weights to Python variables:\n\n```python\nvalues = [30, 50, 70] # The values of the items\nweights = [2, 3, 4] # The volumes of the items (which act as the weights in this problem)\ncapacity = 5 # The capacity of the backpack\n```\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to build a table where the cell at the ith row and jth column represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a capacity of j and items up to i.\n\nHere's a Python function that solves this problem:\n\n```python\ndef knapsack(values, weights, capacity):\n    n = len(values)\n    table = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        for w in range(capacity + 1):\n            if i == 0 or w == 0:\n                table[i][w] = 0\n            elif weights[i-1] <= w:\n                table[i][w] = max(values[i-1] + table[i-1][w-weights[i-1]], table[i-1][w])\n            else:\n                table[i][w] = table[i-1][w]\n                \n    return table[n][capacity]\n\nsolution = knapsack(values, weights, capacity)\n```\n\nThis function first initializes a table with zero values. It then fills the table row by row. For each cell, it checks whether the current item can be included in the knapsack. If it can, it calculates the maximum value that can be achieved by either including the current item or excluding it. The maximum value is then stored in the cell. The function finally returns the maximum value that can be achieved with the given capacity and items, which is stored in the bottom-right cell of the table.",
