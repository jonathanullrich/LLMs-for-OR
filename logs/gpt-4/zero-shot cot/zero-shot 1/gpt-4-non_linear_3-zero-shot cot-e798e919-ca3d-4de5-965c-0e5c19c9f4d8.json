    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A stockbroker has just received a call from his most important client, Ann. Ann has $50,000 to invest and wants to use it to purchase two stocks. Stock 1 is a solid blue-chip security with a respectable growth potential and little risk involved. Stock 2 is much more speculative. It is being touted in two investment newsletters as having outstanding growth potential but also is considered very risky. Ann would like a large return on her investment but also has considerable aversion to risk. Therefore, she has instructed Richard to analyze what mix of investments in the two stocks would be appropriate for her. Ann is used to talking in units of 1,000 dollars and 1,000-share blocks of stocks. Using these units, the price per block is 20 for stock 1 and 30 for stock 2. After doing some research, Richard has made the following estimates. The expected return per block is 5 for stock 1 and 10 for stock 2. The variance of the return on each block is 4 for stock 1 and 100 for stock 2. The covariance of the return on one block each of the two stocks is 5. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars Ann has to invest to achieve a return of 15 percent.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Firstly, we need to determine how many blocks of each stock Ann should buy to minimize the risk while achieving a return of 15 percent. As the return and risk (represented by variance) are given per block, we can regard this as a linear programming problem. Let's denote the number of blocks of stock 1 and stock 2 as x1 and x2 respectively.\n\nThe expected return is given by 5x1 + 10x2, and Ann wants this to be at least 15 percent of her total investment, i.e., 0.15 * 50,000 = 7500. So we have the constraint 5x1 + 10x2 >= 7500.\n\nThe total investment should not exceed Ann's budget, so we have another constraint 20x1 + 30x2 <= 50,000.\n\nThe variance of return can be calculated as 4x1^2 + 100x2^2 + 2*5*x1*x2, and our objective is to minimize this under the constraints.\n\nWe can solve this problem using python's scipy library, which has a built-in function for linear programming.",
