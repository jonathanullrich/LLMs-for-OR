    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: A young couple, Eve and Steven, want to divide their main household chores (marketing, cooking, dishwashing, and laundering) between them so that each has two tasks but the total time they spend on household duties is kept to a minimum. Their efficiencies on these tasks differ, where the time each would need to perform the task is given by the following. Eve needs 4.5 hours for Marketing, 7.8 hours for Cooking, 3.6 hours for Dishwashing and 2.9 hours for Laundry. Steven needs 4.9 hours for Marketing, 7.2 hours for Cooking, 4.3 hours for Dishwashing and 3.1 hours for Laundry. Calculate the miminum time spend to do the chores.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "First, we need to identify the two tasks that each individual can perform the quickest. For Eve, she is quickest at dishwashing and laundry (3.6 hours + 2.9 hours = 6.5 hours). For Steven, he is quickest at marketing and laundry (4.9 hours + 3.1 hours = 8 hours).\n\nSo if we assign the tasks based on their quickest times, the total time spent would be 6.5 hours (Eve) + 8 hours (Steven) = 14.5 hours. \n\nHowever, we have a problem here. Both Eve and Steven are assigned the laundry task. Therefore, we need to adjust the task assignment.\n\nLet's check the second quickest task for Steven which is cooking (7.2 hours). If we replace laundry with cooking for Steven, the total time spent would be 6.5 hours (Eve) + 7.2 hours (Steven for cooking) + 4.9 hours (Steven for marketing) = 12.1 hours. \n\nThis means, Eve should be assigned dishwashing and laundry while Steven should be assigned cooking and marketing. The total minimum time spent on chores would then be 12.1 hours.",
