    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Luxor Travel arranges 1-week tours to southern Egypt. The agency provides 7, 4, 7, and 8 rental cars over the next 4 weeks. Luxor Travel subcontracts with a local car dealer to supply rental needs. The dealer charges a rental fee of $220 per car per week, plus a flat fee of $500 for any rental transaction. Luxor, however, may elect to keep the rentals for an additional week and simply continue to pay the rent. What is the best way for Luxor Travel to handle the rental situation and customer demand? Determine the minimal cost.",
    "examples": null,
    "output": "Definitely. The first step is to understand the costs involved. The cost of renting a car per week is $220. This cost will be incurred for every car, every week.\n\nThe next cost is the $500 transaction fee. This fee is only incurred if a new rental transaction is made, meaning that if Luxor decides to keep the cars for another week, this fee will not apply.\n\nThe demand for the next four weeks is 7, 4, 7, and 8 cars. \n\nThe key to minimizing costs here is to try and minimize the number of transactions. One option could be to rent 8 cars from the start (to cover the maximum demand) and keep them for four weeks. This will only involve one transaction.\n\nHowever, this may not be the most cost-effective option, as Luxor will be paying for more cars than needed in the second week. Another option could be to rent 7 cars in the first week, return 3 in the second week, rent 3 more in the third week, and rent 1 more in the fourth week. This will involve three transactions.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for both these options.\n\nOption 1: Rent 8 cars for four weeks \nCost = 8 cars * 4 weeks * $220/week + 1 transaction * $500 = $7,060\n\nOption 2: Rent 7 cars for first week, return 3 in second week, rent 3 more in third week, rent 1 more in fourth week\nCost = 7 cars * 1 week * $220/week + 1 transaction * $500 (for first week)\n      + 4 cars * 1 week * $220/week (for second week)\n      + 7 cars * 1 week * $220/week + 1 transaction * $500 (for third week)\n      + 8 cars * 1 week * $220/week + 1 transaction * $500 (for fourth week)\n      = $4,620\n\nSo, the second option is more cost-effective. The minimum cost would be $4,620.",
