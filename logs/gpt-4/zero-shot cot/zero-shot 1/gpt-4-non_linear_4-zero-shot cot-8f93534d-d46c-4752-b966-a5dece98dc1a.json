    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: The management of the Albert Hanson Company is trying to determine the best product mix for two new products. Because these products would share the same production facilities, the total number of units produced of the two products combined cannot exceed two per hour. Because of uncertainty about how well these products will sell, the profit from producing each product provides decreasing marginal returns as the production rate is increased. In particular, with a production rate of R1 units per hour, it is estimated that Product 1 would provide a profit per hour of $200*R1 - $100*R1^2. If the production rate of product 2 is R2 units per hour, its estimated profit per hour would be $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. Determine the total profit.",

    "output": "First, we know that R1 and R2 are the production rates of Product 1 and Product 2, respectively, and they cannot exceed 2 units per hour combined. Hence, R1 + R2 <= 2.\n\nSecond, the total profit from producing Product 1 and Product 2 can be calculated by adding the profit from each product. \n\nThe profit from Product 1 is $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 and the profit from Product 2 is $300*R2 - $100*R2^2. \n\nSo, the total profit P for producing R1 units of Product 1 and R2 units of Product 2 is P = $200*R1 - $100*R1^2 + $300*R2 - $100*R2^2.\n\nWe want to maximize this total profit given the constraint R1 + R2 <= 2. \n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved using methods like the Lagrange Multiplier method. However, given that this is a quadratic function, we can also solve it by setting the derivative equal to zero and solving for R1 and R2.\n\nThe derivative of the total profit function with respect to R1 is dP/dR1 = $200 - $200*R1, and with respect to R2 is dP/dR2 = $300 - $200*R2.\n\nSetting these equal to zero gives R1 = 1 and R2 = 1.5. However, R1 + R2 = 2.5 which exceeds our constraint of 2. Therefore, we need to adjust these values so that they add up to 2. \n\nGiven the higher profit margin for Product 2, it would be more beneficial to produce more of Product 2 than Product 1. Therefore, we can set R1 = 0.5 and R2 = 1.5. \n\nSubstituting these values back into our total profit function gives P = $200*0.5 - $100*0.5^2 + $300*1.5 - $100*1.5^2 = $100 - $25 + $450 - $225 = $300. Therefore, the maximum total profit is $300 per hour.",
