    "problem_description": "Consider the following problem: Four jobs must be processed on a single machine. The processing times for the jobs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 6 days, 4 days, 5 days and 8 days, respectively. Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8, Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4, Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16. What is the minimal time to process the jobs?",

    "output": "Given that Job 1 must be completed by the end of day 8 and takes 6 days to process, the earliest we can start is on day 2. Job 2 must be completed by the end of day 4 and takes 4 days to process, meaning it must start on day 1. Job 3 must be completed by the end of day 12 and takes 5 days to process, so it can start on day 7. Finally, Job 4 must be completed by the end of day 16 and takes 8 days to process, so it can start on day 8.\n\nBut we have a constraint of one machine. So, we cannot process more than one job at a time. \n\nSo, the optimal order would be: \n\n- Start Job 2 on Day 1, finish on Day 4\n- Start Job 1 on Day 5, finish on Day 10\n- Start Job 3 on Day 11, finish on Day 15\n- Start Job 4 on Day 16, finish on Day 23\n\nTherefore, the minimal time to process all the jobs is 23 days. \n\nThe python code is not needed in this case as we can solve this problem logically. \n\nSo, the solution is 23.",
